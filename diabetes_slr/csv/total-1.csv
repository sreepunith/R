This may cause repetitive cost and burden for patients and clinicians and require a lot of modeling efforts. Here, to overcome the aforementioned problems, a rapid model development strategy for new subjects is proposed using the idea of model migration for online glucose prediction. Methods: First, a base model is obtained that can be empirically identified from any subject or constructed by a priori knowledge. Then, parameters of inputs in the base model are properly revised based on a small amount of new data from new subjects so that the updated models can reflect the specific glucose dynamics excited by inputs for new subjects. These problems are investigated by developing autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) based on 30 in silico subjects using UVA/Padova metabolic simulator. Results: The prediction accuracy of the rapid modeling method is comparable to that for subject-dependent modeling method for some cases. Also, it can present better generalization ability. Conclusion: The proposed method can be regarded as an effective and economic modeling method instead of repetitive subject-dependent modeling method especially for lack of modeling data."6,,ieee-120,"Sowjanya, K.; Singhal, A. & Choudhary, C.",MobDBTest: A machine learning based system for predicting diabetes risk using mobile devices,,,,,,2015,,,,"Advance Computing Conference (IACC), 2015 IEEE International",,,,,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is reaching possibly epidemic proportions in India. The degree of disease and destruction due to diabetes and its potential complications are enormous, and originated a significant health care burden on both households and society.

In India, the migration of people from rural to urban areas and corresponding modification in lifestyle are all moving the degree of diabetes. Deficiency of knowledge about diabetes causes untimely death among the population at large. Therefore, acquiring a proficiency that should spread awareness about diabetes may affect the people in India. In this work, a mobile/android application based solution to overcome the deficiency of awareness about diabetes has been shown. The application uses novel machine learning techniques to predict diabetes levels for the users. At the same time, the system also provides knowledge about diabetes and some suggestions on the disease. A comparative analysis of four machine learning (ML) algorithms were performed.

After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter i.e., learning rate, and Iteration. Finally, the proposed factors and tuning BNN parameters introduce a high accuracy compared with the baseline up to 1.2%."6,,ieee-116,"San, P. P.; Ling, S. H. & Nguyen, H.

It is dangerous and can result in unconsciousness, seizures and even death. The most common physiological parameter to be effected from hypoglycemic reaction are heart rate (HR) and correct QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Based on physiological parameters, an intelligent diagnostics system, using the hybrid approach of adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), is developed to recognize the presence of hypoglycemia. The proposed ANFIS is characterized by adaptive neural network capabilities and the fuzzy inference system. To optimize the membership functions and adaptive network parameters, a global learning optimization algorithm called hybrid particle swarm optimization with wavelet mutation (HPSOWM) is used. For clinical study, 15 children with Type 1 diabetes volunteered for an overnight study. All the real data sets are collected from theDepartment of Health, Government of Western Australia. Several experiments were conducted with 5 patients each, for a training set (184 data points), a validation set (192 data points) and a testing set (153 data points), which are randomly selected. The effectiveness of the proposed detection method is found to be satisfactory by giving better sensitivity, 79.09% and acceptable specificity, 51.82%."6,,ieee-119,"Chan, Kit Yan; Ling, Sai Ho; Nguyen, H.

It can be used not only to diagnose hypoglycemic episodes in T1DM patients, but also to generate a set of rules, which describe the domains of physiological parameters that lead to hypoglycemic episodes. The hypoglycemic episode diagnosis system addresses the limitations of the traditional neural network approaches which cannot generate implicit information. The performance of the proposed hypoglycemic episode diagnosis system is evaluated by using real T1DM patients' data sets collected from the Department of Health, Government of Western Australia, Australia. Results show that satisfactory diagnosis accuracy can be obtained. Also, explicit knowledge can be produced such that the deficiency of traditional neural networks can be overcome.

This AI system may provide a real-time monitoring of patient's physical condition and adjust the insulin dosage from AI system to facilitate the monitoring, caring, and management of patients. Furthermore, abnormal condition may be detected earlier and then emergency treatment may be provided in time to prevent the occurrence of any unfortunate events caused by negligence. With this system, data of 4 patients was partitioned into training data set (3/2) and test data set (1/3). Training data set was entered into ANM system for an analysis of learning stage to build a prediction model for insulin dosage. Upon the completion, the test data set was tested with this prediction model for the accuracy of dosage control by bioartificial pancreas.

Prolonged episodes of hyperglycemia elevate the risk of the patient developing diabetic complications, which makes infections such as common cold, influenza and influenza like illness more harmful for T1DM patients than the normal population. TTL, NST and AAU are researching a method of predicting illness in T1DM patients, using patient observable parameters. Daily BG measurements are identified as a relevant patient observable parameter, due to early rise when infected and elevated HbA<sub>1C</sub> during illness. A Smartphone based system is developed that allows patients to monitor BG concentrations and report symptoms of illness and illness. Data gathered by patients through use of this device, will be used to test the hypothesis that changes in daily BG measurements can be used to predict illness in T1DM patients, before symptoms onset. A successful prediction model will enable patients to get early indication of upcoming illness, before they are bedridden. Patients can thus actively take precautions to avoid or shorten illness episodes or make these less severe and/or have healthy BG concentrations during illness. This project is breaking new grounds by detecting illness before the onset of symptoms and illness, and an illness prediction model using patient observable parameters will be an important advance in the field of disease surveillance and prediction."6,,ieee-72,"Skevofilakas, M.; Zarkogianni, K.; Karamanos, B.

Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4--6 insulin injections to be taken daily, the aim of this insulin therapy being to maintain normoglycemia--- i.e., a blood glucose level between 4--7 mmol/L. To determine the quantity and timing of these injections, various different approaches are used. Currently, mostly qualitative and semi-quantitative models and reasoning are used to design such a therapy. Here, an attempt is made to show how system identification and control may be used to estimate predictive quantitative models to be used in design of optimal insulin regimens. The system was divided into three subsystems, the insulin subsystem, the glucose subsystem and the insulin-glucose interaction. The insulin subsystem aims to describe the absorbtion of injected insulin from the subcutaneous depots and the glucose subsystem the absorbtion of glucose from the gut following a meal. These subsystems were modeled using compartment models and proposed models found in the literature. Several black-box models and grey-box models describing the insulin/glucose interaction were developed and analysed. These models were fitted to real data monitored by a IDDM patient. Many difficulties were encountered, typical of biomedical systems: Non-uniform and scarce sampling, time-varying dynamics and severe nonlinearities were some of the difficulties encountered during the modeling. None of the proposed models were able to describe the system accurately in all aspects during all conditions. However, all the linear models shared some dynamics.

The insulin preparation shows peak action at several hours after subcutaneous administration. For this reason, unstable blood glucose is often caused by intensive insulin therapy with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). The insulin requirement is determined in proportion to fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the sliding scale method. A fixed amount of insulin is administered regardless of FBG level in the constant insulin method. It is indispensable to estimate FBG at peak time, when insulin works the hardest, to obtain the appropriate effect of insulin administration. We employed the local fuzzy reconstruction method based on chaos theory for predicting FBG at peak time. The direction to change the FBG at peak time is predicted with a 70-90% success rate. The amount of insulin administration is adjusted based on predicted FBG level. After predictive glycemic control (PGC) for around one year, the FBG average approached the normal range, standard deviation (SD) reduced by half, and hyperglycemia decreased."7,,ISI:000087467400008,"Hernando, M.

The objective of this study was to create a tool that    accurately predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with    type 2 diabetes according to an oral hypoglycemic agent.    Materials and Methods. The model was based on a cohort of 33,067    patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed a single oral    hypoglycemic agent at the Cleveland Clinic between 1998 and 2006.    Competing risk regression models were created for coronary heart disease    (CHD), heart failure, and stroke, while a Cox regression model was    created for mortality. Propensity scores were used to account for    possible treatment bias. A prediction tool was created and internally    validated using tenfold cross-validation. The results were compared to a    Framingham model and a model based on the United Kingdom Prospective    Diabetes Study (UKPDS) for CHD and stroke, respectively.    Results and Discussion. Median follow-up for the mortality outcome was    769 days. The numbers of patients experiencing events were as follows:    CHD (3062), heart failure (1408), stroke (1451), and mortality (3661).    The prediction tools demonstrated the following concordance indices    (c-statistics) for the specific outcomes: CHD (0.730), heart failure    (0.753), stroke (0.688), and mortality (0.719). The prediction tool was    superior to the Framingham model at predicting CHD and was at least as    accurate as the UKPDS model at predicting stroke.    Conclusions.

Results The algorithm achieved 98\% and 100\% positive predictive values    for the identification of diabetic cases and controls, respectively, as    compared against clinician review.

Most of the researchers have proposed    different systems to diagnose diabetes, in spite of which the accuracy    of the prediction rate of diabetes is not so significant. Most of the    techniques suggested were to detect diabetes associated with the parts    of the body such as eye, heart or legs. All the developed systems aimed    to identify diabetes by increasing the accuracy of the prediction rate    but fail to do so in most of the cases as there were some issues that    had not been discussed. The existing systems had number of drawbacks    like some were only concentrated for women and who were less than 21    years old {[}5], some gave greater accuracy if only one data set was    used {[}6], some needed dataset of very good quality {[}12], some needed    to standardize the ontology {[}10] and some even failed to show the    performance of the developed systems {[}7]. So there is an need to    develop a diabetes diagnosis system that improves the accuracy of the    prediction rate by considering all the factors into account. This paper    presents a novel approach for diagnosis of diabetes which has two stages    to predict the diabetes status. The initial prediction stage adopts two    computational intelligence and knowledge engineering techniques such as    fuzzy logic (F), neural network (N) and case based reasoning (C) as an    individual approach (FCN). The final prediction stage applies rule based    algorithm to the values obtained from the initial stage. The benefit of    applying these stages is that the accuracy of prediction rate will be    higher when compared to using only the initial prediction stage done by    most of the suggested systems for predicting the occurrence of diabetes    mellitus.

This data was utilized to develop and train a neural network    model for real-time prediction of serum glucose concentration    implementing a prediction horizon of 75 minutes.

Subsequent    real-time simulated testing was performed in 5 patients to whom the    neural network model was naive. Performance of the model was evaluated    by calculating the mean absolute difference percent (MAD\%), Clarke    Error Grid Analysis, and calculation of the percent of hypoglycemic (<=    70 mg/dL), normoglycemic (>70 and <150 mg/dL), and hyperglycemic (>= 150    mg/dL) values accurately predicted by the model; 9,405 data points were    analyzed.

We aim to evaluate the time interval between    pre-diabetes to diabetes with anti-diabetic drugs by using HbA1C as a    diagnostic tool, and predicting it using a mathematic model.    Methods: We used the Taipei Medical University Affiliated Hospital    Patient Profile Database (AHPPD) from January-2007 to June-2011. The    patients who progressed and were prescribed anti-diabetic drugs were    selected from AHPPD. The mathematical model used to predict the time    interval of HbA1C value ranged from 5.7\% to 6.5\% for diabetes    progression.    Results: We predicted an average overall time interval for all    participants in between 5.7\% to 6.5\% during a total of 907 days    (standard error, 103 days). For each group found among 5.7\% to 6.5\% we    determined 1169.3 days for the low risk group (i.e 3.2 years), 1080.5    days (i.e 2.96 years) for the increased risk group and 729.4 days (i.e    1.99 years) for the diabetes group.

Conclusion: This prediction model is very useful to help prioritize the    diagnosis at an early stage for targeting individuals with risk of    diabetes. Using patients' HbA1C before anti-diabetes drugs are used we    predicted the time interval from prediabetes progression to diabetes is    2.49 years without any influence of age and gender.

Nevertheless, many medical science    researchers believe that complex diseases are caused by a combination of    genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Detection of such    diseases becomes an issue because it is not free from false presumptions    and is accompanied by unpredictable effects. Given the greatly increased    amount of data gathered in medical databases, data mining has been used    widely in recent years to detect and improve the diagnosis of complex    diseases. However, past research showed that no single classifier can be    considered optimal for all problems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus    on employing multiple classifier systems to improve the accuracy of    detection for complex diseases, such as T2DM. We proposed a dynamic    weighted voting scheme called multiple factors weighted combination for    classifiers' decision combination. This method considers not only the    local and global accuracy but also the diversity among classifiers and    localized generalization error of each classifier. We evaluated our    method on two real T2DM data sets and other medical data sets.

Background: Depression is a common and often undiagnosed condition for    patients with diabetes. It is also a condition that significantly    impacts healthcare outcomes, use, and cost as well as elevating suicide    risk. Therefore, a model to predict depression among diabetes patients    is a promising and valuable tool for providers to proactively assess    depressive symptoms and identify those with depression.    Objectives: This study seeks to develop a generalized multilevel    regression model, using a longitudinal data set from a recent    large-scale clinical trial, to predict depression severity and presence    of major depression among patients with diabetes.    Methods: Severity of depression was measured by the Patient Health    Questionnaire PHQ-9 score. Predictors were selected from 29 candidate    factors to develop a 2-level Poisson regression model that can make    population-average predictions for all patients and subject-specific    predictions for individual patients with historical records. Newly    obtained patient records can be incorporated with historical records to    update the prediction model. Root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were used to    evaluate predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores. The study also evaluated    the classification ability of using the predicted PHQ-9 scores to    classify patients as having major depression.    Results: Two time-invariant and 10 time-varying predictors were selected    for the model. Incorporating historical records and using them to update    the model may improve both predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores and    classification ability of the predicted scores. Subject-specific    predictions (for individual patients with historical records) achieved    RMSE about 4 and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)    curve about 0.9 and are better than population-average predictions.    Conclusions: The study developed a generalized multilevel regression    model to predict depression and demonstrated that using generalized    multilevel regression based on longitudinal patient records can achieve    high predictive ability.}"7,,ISI:000367481900081,"Okwechime, Ifechukwude Obiamaka; Roberson, Shamarial & Odoi, Agricola",Prevalence and Predictors of Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes among Adults 18 Years or Older in Florida: A Multinomial Logistic Modeling Approach,{PLOS ONE},{10},{12},{DEC 29},,2015,,,,,,,,,"{Background    Individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes have increased risks of    developing macro-vascular complications including heart disease and    stroke; which are the leading causes of death globally. The objective of    this study was to estimate the prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes,    and to investigate their predictors among adults >= 18 years in Florida.    Methods    Data covering the time period January-December 2013, were obtained from    Florida's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Survey    design of the study was declared using SVYSET statement of STATA 13.1.    Descriptive analyses were performed to estimate the prevalence of    pre-diabetes and diabetes. Predictors of pre-diabetes and diabetes were    investigated using multinomial logistic regression model. Model    goodness-of-fit was evaluated using both the multinomial goodness-of-fit    test proposed by Fagerland, Hosmer, and Bofin, as well as, the    Hosmer-Lemeshow's goodness of fit test.    Results    There were approximately 2,983 (7.3\%) and 5,189 (12.1\%) adults in    Florida diagnosed with pre-diabetes and diabetes, respectively. Over    half of the study respondents were white, married and over the age of 45    years while 36.4\% reported being physically inactive, overweight    (36.4\%) or obese (26.4\%), hypertensive (34.6\%), hypercholesteremic    (40.3\%), and 26\% were arthritic. Based on the final multivariable    multinomial model, only being overweight (Relative Risk Ratio {[}RRR] =    1.85, 95\% Confidence Interval {[}95\% CI] = 1.41, 2.42), obese (RRR =    3.41, 95\% CI = 2.61, 4.45), hypertensive (RRR = 1.69, 95\% CI = 1.33,    2.15), hypercholesterolemic (RRR = 1.94, 95\% CI = 1.55, 2.43), and    arthritic (RRR = 1.24, 95\% CI = 1.00, 1.55) had significant    associations with pre-diabetes. However, more predictors had significant    associations with diabetes and the strengths of associations tended to    be higher than for the association with pre-diabetes. For instance, the    relative risk ratios for the association between diabetes and being    overweight (RRR = 2.00, 95\% CI = 1.55, 2.57), or obese (RRR = 4.04,    95\% CI = 3.22, 5.07), hypertensive (RRR = 2.66, 95\% CI = 2.08, 3.41),    hypercholesterolemic (RRR = 1.98, 95\% CI = 1.61, 2.45) and arthritic    (RRR = 1.28, 95\% CI = 1.04, 1.58) were all further away from the null    than their associations with pre-diabetes. Moreover, a number of    variables such as age, income level, sex, and level of physical activity    had significant association with diabetes but not pre-diabetes. The risk    of diabetes increased with increasing age, lower income, in males, and    with physical inactivity. Insufficient physical activity had no    significant association with the risk of diabetes or prediabetes.    Conclusions    There is evidence of differences in the strength of association of the    predictors across levels of diabetes status (pre-diabetes and diabetes)    among adults >= 18 years in Florida.

Purpose: To use data mining techniques to develop a model for predicting    the development of liver cancer within 6 years of diagnosis with type II    diabetes.    Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research    Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, which covers approximately 22 million    people. In this study, we selected patients who were newly diagnosed    with type II diabetes during the 2000-2003 periods, with no prior cancer    diagnosis. We then used encrypted personal ID to perform data linkage    with the cancer registry database to identify whether these patients    were diagnosed with liver cancer. Finally, we identified 2060 cases and    assigned them to a case group (patients diagnosed with liver cancer    after diabetes) and a control group (patients with diabetes but no liver    cancer). The risk factors were identified from the literature review and    physicians' suggestion, then, chi-square test was conducted on each    independent variable (or potential risk factor) for a comparison between    patients with liver cancer and those without, those found to be    significant were selected as the factors. We subsequently performed data    training and testing to construct artificial neural network (ANN) and    logistic regression (LR) prediction models. The dataset was randomly    divided into 2 groups: a training group and a test group. The training    group consisted of 1442 cases (70\% of the entire dataset), and the    prediction model was developed on the basis of the training group. The    remaining 30\% (618 cases) were assigned to the test group for model    validation.    Results: The following 10 variables were used to develop the ANN and LR    models: sex, age, alcoholic cirrhosis, nonalcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic    hepatitis, viral hepatitis, other types of chronic hepatitis, alcoholic    fatty liver disease, other types of fatty liver disease, and    hyperlipidemia. The performance of the ANN was superior to that of LR,    according to the sensitivity (0.757), specificity (0.755), and the area    under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.873). After    developing the optimal prediction model, we base on this model to    construct a web-based application system for liver cancer prediction,    which can provide support to physicians during consults with diabetes    patients.    Conclusion: In the original dataset (n = 2060), 33\% of diabetes    patients were diagnosed with liver cancer (n = 515). After using 70\% of    the original data to training the model and other 30\% for testing, the    sensitivity and specificity of our model were 0.757 and 0.755,    respectively; this means that 75.7\% of diabetes patients can be    predicted correctly to receive a future liver cancer diagnosis, and    75.5\% can be predicted correctly to not be diagnosed with liver cancer.    These results reveal that this model can be used as effective predictors    of liver cancer for diabetes patients, after discussion with physicians;    they also agreed that model can assist physicians to advise potential    liver cancer patients and also helpful to decrease the future cost    incurred upon cancer treatment.

Methods: Five years after GDM, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)    was performed in 362 women, excluding women already diagnosed with    diabetes at 1-to 2-year follow-up or later (n = 45). All but 21 women    had results from follow-up at 1-2 years, while 84 women were lost from    that point. Predictive variables were identified by logistic regression    analysis.    Results: Five years after GDM, 28/362 women (8 \%) were diagnosed with    diabetes whereas 187/362 (52 \%) had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Of    the latter, 139/187 (74 \%) also had NGT at 1-to 2-year follow-up. In    simple regression analysis, using NGT at 1-2 years and at 5 years as the    reference, diabetes at 1-to 2-year follow-up or later was clearly    associated with easily assessable clinical variables, such as BMI at    1-to 2-year follow-up, 2-h OGTT glucose concentration during pregnancy,    and non-European origin (P < 0.0001).
