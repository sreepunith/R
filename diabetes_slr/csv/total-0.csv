The proposed platform comprises two main components: a smartphone-based patient platform allowing manual input of glucose and variables affecting blood glucose levels (e.g., meal carbohydrate content and exercise) and providing real-time insulin bolus recommendations; and a clinical revision platform to supervise the automatic adaptations of the bolus calculator parameters. The system implements a previously in silico validated bolus calculator algorithm based on case-based reasoning, which uses information from similar past events (i.e., cases) to suggest improved personalized insulin bolus recommendations and automatically learns from new events. Usability of ABC4D was assessed by analyzing the system usage at the end of a six-week pilot study (n = 10). Further feedback on the use of ABC4D has been obtained from each participant at the end of the study from a usability questionnaire. On average, each participant requested 115 $pm$ 21 insulin recommendations, of which 103 $pm$ 28 (90%) were accepted. The clinical revision software proposed a total of 754 case revisions, where 723 (96%) adaptations were approved by a clinical expert and updated in the patient platform."ieee-46,"Jung, M.; Park, S.

This may cause repetitive cost and burden for patients and clinicians and require a lot of modeling efforts. Here, to overcome the aforementioned problems, a rapid model development strategy for new subjects is proposed using the idea of model migration for online glucose prediction. Methods: First, a base model is obtained that can be empirically identified from any subject or constructed by a priori knowledge. Then, parameters of inputs in the base model are properly revised based on a small amount of new data from new subjects so that the updated models can reflect the specific glucose dynamics excited by inputs for new subjects. These problems are investigated by developing autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) based on 30 in silico subjects using UVA/Padova metabolic simulator. Results: The prediction accuracy of the rapid modeling method is comparable to that for subject-dependent modeling method for some cases. Also, it can present better generalization ability. Conclusion: The proposed method can be regarded as an effective and economic modeling method instead of repetitive subject-dependent modeling method especially for lack of modeling data."ieee-117,"Wang, L.; Pedersen, P. C.; Strong, D. M.; Tulu, B.; Agu, E. & Ignotz, R.",Smartphone-Based Wound Assessment System for Patients With Diabetes,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,"Diabetic foot ulcers represent a significant health issue. Currently, clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smartphones with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analyzing images of chronic foot ulcers is an attractive option. In this paper, we propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the Android smartphone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the smartphone with the assistance of an image capture box. After that, the smartphone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the foot is determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the healing status is next assessed based on red-yellow-black color evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient. Experimental results on wound images collected in UMASS-Memorial Health Center Wound Clinic (Worcester, MA) following an Institutional Review Board approved protocol show that our system can be efficiently used to analyze the wound healing status with promising accuracy."ieee-120,"Sowjanya, K.; Singhal, A. & Choudhary, C.",MobDBTest: A machine learning based system for predicting diabetes risk using mobile devices,,,,,,2015,,,,"Advance Computing Conference (IACC), 2015 IEEE International",,,,,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is reaching possibly epidemic proportions in India.

A total of 4870 subjects (2955 females and 1915 males) participated in this study. Based on 37 anthropometric measures, we compared predictions of FPG status using individual versus combined measures using two machine-learning algorithms. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the predictions by logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier based on the combination of measures were 0.741 and 0.739 in females, respectively, and were 0.687 and 0.686 in males, respectively. Our results indicate that prediction of FPG status using a combination of anthropometric measures was superior to individual measures alone in both females and males.

Unfortunately, sensor abnormality has not been well analyzed and detected online although it is a very popular problem in real case and may result in unreliable CGM measurements. In the present work, a sensor abnormality detection method is developed based on prediction errors to identify sensor problems online. And the feasibility of a global prediction model for sensor abnormality detection is addressed by comparing the detection results based on prediction errors using subject-dependent prediction model and those using a global model. Different from the conventional glucose monitoring which in fact works as a low-level monitoring tool and focuses on direct realtime display of CGM readings, the proposed method is deemed to be a super-level monitoring tool which focuses on detecting the undesirable sensor abnormality by analyzing the underlying time-wise glucose correlations.

In this paper, we describe the design of a novel breath analysis system for this purpose. The system uses carefully selected chemical sensors to detect biomarkers in breath. Common interferential factors, including humidity and the ratio of alveolar air in breath, are compensated or handled in the algorithm. Considering the intersubject variance of the components in breath, we build subject-specific prediction models to improve the accuracy of BGL prediction. A total of 295 breath samples from healthy subjects and 279 samples from diabetic subjects were collected to evaluate the performance of the system. The sensitivity and specificity of diabetes screening are 91.51% and 90.77%, respectively. The mean relative absolute error for BGL prediction is 21.7%.

We contribute to the area of SVN composition by replacing current assumptions that customers are actively involved in explicating their service requirements with a more tacit approach where requirements are derived from patterns in sensor readings (and corollary diagnosis) based on validated rules on the customer side as well as on the supplier side. We demonstrate our contributions with an SVN composition based on an initial set of 493 patient profiles in the context of Type 2 Diabetes management in Australia.ieee-9,"Kumar, P. G.; Vijay, S. A.

But its high dimensional low sample nature poses a lot of difficulties when it is analyzed by hand and needs an automatic system. As against statistical and machine learning approaches, fuzzy expert system provides an understandable diagnostic system. An important issue in the design of fuzzy expert system is knowledge acquisition. This paper presents a hybrid colony algorithm to extract if-then rules and to form membership functions from diabetes microarray data. During the run, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is used to generate optimal rule set and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is used to evolve the points of membership function. Mutual Information is used for identification of informative genes. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using two diabetes microarray data sets. From the simulation study, it is found that the proposed approach generated an accurate fuzzy system with interpretable rules when compared with other approaches."ieee-94,"Dalakleidi, K.

For the development and the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, data from the medical records of 560 patients with T2DM are used. The best subsets of features proposed by the implemented algorithm include the most common risk factors, such as age at diagnosis, duration of diagnosed diabetes, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol concentration, and smoking habit, but also factors related to the presence of other diabetes complications and the use of antihypertensive and diabetes treatment drugs (i.e. proteinuria, calcium antagonists, b-blockers, diguanides and insulin). The obtained results demonstrate that the best performance was achieved when the weighted k-nearest neighbours classifier was applied to the CVD dataset with the best subset of features selected by the GA, which resulted in high levels of accuracy (0.96), sensitivity (0.80) and specificity (0.98)."Prasanna:2013:DSS:2534504.2534541,"Prasanna, Prateek; Jain, Shubham; Bhagat, Neelakshi & Madabhushi, Anant",Decision Support System for Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Smartphones,,,,,176--179,2013,"ICST, Brussels, Belgium, Belgium",,http://dx.doi.org/10.4108/icst.pervasivehealth.2013.252093,Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare,,,PervasiveHealth '13,,St.Jean:2013:PRL:2655780.2655840,"St. Jean, Beth","Participant Reactivity in a Longitudinal Mixed-method Study of the Information Behavior of People with Type 2 Diabetes: Research Validity vs. Street Validity""""",,,,,60:1--60:10,2013,"Silver Springs, MD, USA",,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2655780.2655840,Proceedings of the 76th ASIS\&T Annual Meeting: Beyond the Cloud: Rethinking Information Boundaries,,,ASIST '13,,ieee-0,"Sultan, S. & Mohan, P.",A peer-facilitated diabetes self-care management support system using mobile telephony,,,,,,2012,,,,2012 6th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth) and Workshops,,,,,"This paper presents a mobile health system called Mobile DSMS which is based on the collaborative disease management framework using mobile technologies.

However, the accuracy is not higher. This paper presents new factors that are smoking and alcohol consumption to improve accuracy in diabetes prediction. Some traditional factors i.e., body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) and Family History (FMH) are also proposed to extent by adjusting and additional range. The proposed diabetes prediction method is based on BNN. Approximately 2,000 cases of Thai people at BMC hospital, Thailand during 2010 to 2012 are used to train the BNN. From experiment results, each proposed factors i.e., FMH, Alcohol consumption factor, Smoking Factors and WC gives a value of accuracy that is higher than baseline as 83.35%, 83.5%, 83.6% and 83.65%, respectively. After that, this paper focuses on tuning neural network parameter, which is divided into 3 main steps: number of hidden nodes, sequence of integrating the proposed factors, and other parameter i.e., learning rate, and Iteration.

The application incorporates activity recognition via a built-in accelerometer on the iPhone, which monitors any physical activity and adjusts predictions accordingly. Also, a reward component interface was incorporated that is intended to enhance patient compliance and encourage mainly teenagers to take control and improve their blood glucose regulation. The individualized prediction algorithm was tested and verified with real patient data. Different physical activities were also examined and classified for an accurate activity recognition component.

Our results indicated that the HbAlc concentration at frequency distribution P50 as measured in DM is 5.94%. HbAlc is correlated with FPG and 2hPG, with correlation coefficient r1=0.48998 and r2= 0.29995, respectively. The relevance analysis of HbAlc concentration and DM complication shows that the higher the HbAlc content is, the higher the incidence rate of DM complication will be. Therefore, HbAlc shows a high specificity for DM diagnosis.

Prolonged episodes of hyperglycemia elevate the risk of the patient developing diabetic complications, which makes infections such as common cold, influenza and influenza like illness more harmful for T1DM patients than the normal population. TTL, NST and AAU are researching a method of predicting illness in T1DM patients, using patient observable parameters. Daily BG measurements are identified as a relevant patient observable parameter, due to early rise when infected and elevated HbA<sub>1C</sub> during illness. A Smartphone based system is developed that allows patients to monitor BG concentrations and report symptoms of illness and illness. Data gathered by patients through use of this device, will be used to test the hypothesis that changes in daily BG measurements can be used to predict illness in T1DM patients, before symptoms onset. A successful prediction model will enable patients to get early indication of upcoming illness, before they are bedridden. Patients can thus actively take precautions to avoid or shorten illness episodes or make these less severe and/or have healthy BG concentrations during illness. This project is breaking new grounds by detecting illness before the onset of symptoms and illness, and an illness prediction model using patient observable parameters will be an important advance in the field of disease surveillance and prediction."ieee-97,"Al-Fandi, M.; Jaradat, M.

The incredible progression in micro and nanotechnology has brought the concept of an ``artificial pancreas'' closer to reality. Manufacturing miniaturized, implantable insulin sensing and delivery devices are in fact feasible. The key to a successful implantable delivery system is the development of a self-regulated arrangement that mimics the performance of the real pancreas. The PID-FLC can be an effective control strategy for implantable insulin delivery system. It combines all the necessary components that react to the possible changes of glucose concentration in the blood stream. This paper is concerned with the parallel structure design of the PID-FLC which is achieved by combining the Proportional-Integral (PI-FLC) and Proportional-Derivative (PD-FLC) controllers. The PID-FLC is implemented on the nonlinear delay differential model of the glucose-insulin regulatory system, which describes how glucose and insulin interact in healthy individuals.

So if it is done manually, it would restrict to the experience and knowledge of these professionals, and consume lots of expensive medical resources as well. The main purpose of this research is to use artificial intelligence techniques to generate personalized diabetes care plan. To do that, we first use case-based reasoning to search matched diabetes care plan in our case database according to personal condition and similarity function. The matched plan can be used directly or further modify it to better fit current problem. The modified case is saved in our case database for next time usage. The expansion of case database makes the system can propose care plan more in line with user requirement later. When there is no matched case, embedded in our system is a diabetes care ontology which can be consulted. The ontology generated a basic care plan to care professionals for adjustment. Again, this adjusted plan becomes the new case and the system deposits it in case database. The result of our research shows our system can provide personalized diabetes care plan efficiently.

Daily compensation of the deficiency requires 4--6 insulin injections to be taken daily, the aim of this insulin therapy being to maintain normoglycemia--- i.e., a blood glucose level between 4--7 mmol/L. To determine the quantity and timing of these injections, various different approaches are used. Currently, mostly qualitative and semi-quantitative models and reasoning are used to design such a therapy. Here, an attempt is made to show how system identification and control may be used to estimate predictive quantitative models to be used in design of optimal insulin regimens. The system was divided into three subsystems, the insulin subsystem, the glucose subsystem and the insulin-glucose interaction. The insulin subsystem aims to describe the absorbtion of injected insulin from the subcutaneous depots and the glucose subsystem the absorbtion of glucose from the gut following a meal. These subsystems were modeled using compartment models and proposed models found in the literature. Several black-box models and grey-box models describing the insulin/glucose interaction were developed and analysed. These models were fitted to real data monitored by a IDDM patient. Many difficulties were encountered, typical of biomedical systems: Non-uniform and scarce sampling, time-varying dynamics and severe nonlinearities were some of the difficulties encountered during the modeling. None of the proposed models were able to describe the system accurately in all aspects during all conditions. However, all the linear models shared some dynamics. Based on the estimated models, short-term blood glucose predictors for up to two-hour-ahead blood glucose prediction were investigated."ieee-63,"Yeh, Yu-Ting; Wu, Shwu-Jiuan; Liu, Chien-Tsai & Lee, Ting-I.",Assessment of user satisfaction with an Internet-based integrated patient education system for diabetes management,,,,,,2008,,,,"e-health Networking, Applications and Services, 2008.

The model comprises a Compartmental Model (CM), which simulates the absorption of the glucose to the blood due to meal intakes, and a Neural Network (NN), which simulates the glucose-insulin kinetics. The NN is a Recurrent NN (RNN) trained with the Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm. The output of the model consists of short term glucose predictions and provides input to the NMPC, in order for the latter to estimate the optimum insulin infusion rates.

In recent years, researchers have identified many genes that play important roles in the onset, development and progression of diabetes. Identification of these diabetes genes offers better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, which is essential for developing preventative and therapeutic methods. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach, fuzzy membership test (FM-test), based on fuzzy set theory to identify diabetes associated genes from micro array gene expression profiles. A new concept of FM d-value is defined to quantify the divergence of two sets of values. Experiments were conducted to study the distribution of d-values and the relationship between the d-value and the significance level of p-value. We applied FM-test to a gene expression dataset obtained from insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant people and identified ten significant genes. Six of the ten have been confirmed to be associated with diabetes in the literature and one has been suggested by other researchers.

The insulin preparation shows peak action at several hours after subcutaneous administration. For this reason, unstable blood glucose is often caused by intensive insulin therapy with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG). The insulin requirement is determined in proportion to fasting blood glucose (FBG) in the sliding scale method. A fixed amount of insulin is administered regardless of FBG level in the constant insulin method. It is indispensable to estimate FBG at peak time, when insulin works the hardest, to obtain the appropriate effect of insulin administration. We employed the local fuzzy reconstruction method based on chaos theory for predicting FBG at peak time. The direction to change the FBG at peak time is predicted with a 70-90% success rate. The amount of insulin administration is adjusted based on predicted FBG level. After predictive glycemic control (PGC) for around one year, the FBG average approached the normal range, standard deviation (SD) reduced by half, and hyperglycemia decreased."ieee-64,"Nagakura, T.; Maruo, S. & Ikuta, K.",The study of micro blood sugar control device without energy supply for diabetes therapy,,,,,,2003,,,,"TRANSDUCERS, Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, 12th International Conference on, 2003",,,,,"The diabetes mellitus results from lack of insulin.

Standard insulin therapy may not maintain blood    glucose concentrations within the relatively narrow range that occurs in    the presence of normal pancreatic beta cells(7).

In humans, a link between the gut    immune system and type 1 diabetes has also been suggested. Early    introduction of cow milk formulas in infancy may increase the risk of    type 1 diabetes. We have demonstrated that primary immunization to a    beta cell-specific autoantigen, insulin, occurs in the gut by exposure    to cow milk formulas, which contain immunogenic bovine insulin. The    induced antibody and T cell responses to bovine insulin cross-react with    human insulin. In children at genetic risk who developed beta cell    autoimmunity, bovine insulin-binding antibodies increased during    follow-up in contrast to autoantibody-negative children. This suggests    that insulin-specific immune response induced by dietary insulin may not    be controlled in children prone to beta cell autoimmunity. The gut    immune system has a key role in controlling insulin-specific immunity    induced by dietary insulin. Indeed, indications for aberrant function of    the gut immune system have been reported in type 1 diabetes, such as    intestinal immune activation and increased intestinal permeability.

One view is that a gradual fall in beta cell    mass begins soon after the onset of insulitis. Another view is that a    sudden wave of beta cell destruction occurs just before the onset of    diabetes. To clarify how the beta cell mass is reduced, we performed    adoptive transfer experiments and examined the relationship between the    pancreatic status of NOD donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes    into NOD-scid recipients. Methods-We killed 18-week-old female NOD mice    (n = 20), removed their spleen, and transferred splenocytes into    5-week-old female NOD-scid mice (n = 60). The relationship between the    pancreatic status of donors and the time taken to transfer diabetes into    recipients was assessed. As pancreatic status, we measured insulin    content and severity of insulitis. Results-There was no linear    correlation between the pancreatic status of donors and the time taken    to transfer diabetes into recipients. NOD donors who needed 7 or more    weeks to transfer diabetes in NOD-scid recipients had similar levels of    insulin content or severity of insulitis as those of NOD donors who    could not transfer diabetes. On the other hand, NOD donors who needed 6    or less weeks to transfer diabetes in recipients had similar levels of    insulin content or severity of insulitis as those of diabetic NOD mice.

Glutamic acid decarboxylase 65    antibody (GADA)-positive patients were randomly divided into 2 groups:    one group received insulin (Ins group), the other a sulfonylurea (SU    group). Fifty-four patients (24 Ins group, 30 SU group) were analyzed at    the end of a 4-year period. All patients underwent a 75 g oral-glucose    test (O-GTT) every 6-12 months. The insulin-dependent stage was defined    based on an integrated value of serum C-peptide levels on O-GTT    (SigmaCPR; sum of CPR at 0, 30,60,90, and 120 min) below 4.0 ng/mL. The    SigmaCPR in the SU group decreased progressively from 22.0 +/- 10.6 to    11.3 +/- 7.5 ng/mL over the 48-month period (p < 0.001 vs. baseline).    The SigmaCPR in the Ins group was unchanged. Among the SU group, 30\% of    subjects (9/30) progressed to IDDM, while 8.3\% of Ins group subjects    (2/24) progressed to IDDM (P = 0.087). With regard to the subjects who    had a preserved C-peptide response (SigmaCPR greater than or equal to 10    ng/mL), the proportion of SU group subjects who progressed to IDDM was    significantly higher than that of the Ins group (7/28, 25\% vs. 0/21,    0\%, p = 0.015). Among subjects with a high GADA titer (greater than or    equal to0 U/mL), 9/14 (64.3\%) of the SU group, but only 2/16 (12.5\%)    of the Ins group, developed IDDM (p = 0.0068). As to those with a high    GADA titer and a preserved C-peptide response, SU group subjects    progressed to IDDM (7/12,58.3\%) more frequently than Ins group subjects    (0/14, 0\%) (p = 0.0012). In summary, our results suggest that small    doses of insulin effectively prevent beta cell failure in slowly    progressive type 1 diabetes.

This study aims at identifying and applying suitable methods for a    cost-benefit analysis from the perspective of the payor for health    services.    Methods: For cost analysis MOSAIK-M was used, a method and tool for    health information systems analysis and design. Two MOSAIK-M models were    created describing conventional insulin pump based diabetes care (CSII),    and INCA based diabetes care. Both models were parameterised with costs    and simulated to determine yearly costs of diabetes management and    treatment for a patient with no diabetes related complications.    Probability of developing complications and their duration were    determined based on the Archimedes model. It was parameterised with    results of a clinical study concerning HbA1c-value changes using the    INCA system compared with conventional CSII. The simulation results in    form of years of disease within a 30-year time frame were multiplied    with corresponding treatment costs.    Results: Yearly costs of conventional insulin CSII for a diabetes type 1    patient are D 5908 (German health care system). Using INCA based on the    clinical study setting would raise yearly costs by (sic)2233. 24\% of    the INCA costs are generated by the continuous blood glucose measurement    device, 5\% by IT devices and services. Considering also diabetes    related complications in a 30-year time frame and HbA1c value reductions    from 7.9 and 7.6\% (conventional CSII) to 7.5 and 7.3\% (INCA) reduces    the additional costs of INCA to D 2102 and (sic)2162.    Conclusions: The approach produces an estimation of a lower bound for    cost savings concerning the treatment of diabetes related complications    in a 30-year time frame. These savings alone do not prove cost    efficiency of the INCA approach. Further work is needed to improve the    approximation and to include indirect and intangible costs.

Paradoxically, epidemiological and experimental    data have shown that some microorganisms can also prevent these    pathologies. This observation is at the origin of the hygiene hypothesis    according to which the decline of infections in western countries is at    the origin of the increased incidence of both Th1-mediated autoimmune    diseases and Th2-mediated allergic diseases over the last decades. We    have tested whether Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation can    recapitulate the protective effect of infectious agents on allergy and    autoimmunity.    Methods and Findings: Here, we performed a systematic study of the    disease-modifying effects of a set of natural or synthetic TLR agonists    using two experimental models, ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma and    spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, presenting the same genetic background    of the non obese diabetic mouse (NOD) that is highly susceptible to both    pathologies. In the same models, we also investigated the effect of    probiotics. Additionally, we examined the effect of the genetic    invalidation of MyD88 on the development of allergic asthma and    spontaneous diabetes. We demonstrate that multiple TLR agonists prevent    from both allergy and autoimmunity when administered parenterally.    Probiotics which stimulate TLRs also protect from these two diseases.    The physiological relevance of these findings is further suggested by    the major acceleration of OVA-induced asthma in MyD88 invalidated mice.    Our results strongly indicate that the TLR-mediated effects involve    immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and transforming    growth factor (TGF)-beta and different subsets of regulatory T cells,    notably CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells for TLR4 agonists and NKT cells    for TLR3 agonists.    Conclusions/Significance: These observations demonstrate that systemic    administration of TLR ligands can suppress both allergic and autoimmune    responses.

The objective of this study was to create a tool that    accurately predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with    type 2 diabetes according to an oral hypoglycemic agent.    Materials and Methods. The model was based on a cohort of 33,067    patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed a single oral    hypoglycemic agent at the Cleveland Clinic between 1998 and 2006.    Competing risk regression models were created for coronary heart disease    (CHD), heart failure, and stroke, while a Cox regression model was    created for mortality. Propensity scores were used to account for    possible treatment bias. A prediction tool was created and internally    validated using tenfold cross-validation. The results were compared to a    Framingham model and a model based on the United Kingdom Prospective    Diabetes Study (UKPDS) for CHD and stroke, respectively.    Results and Discussion. Median follow-up for the mortality outcome was    769 days. The numbers of patients experiencing events were as follows:    CHD (3062), heart failure (1408), stroke (1451), and mortality (3661).    The prediction tools demonstrated the following concordance indices    (c-statistics) for the specific outcomes: CHD (0.730), heart failure    (0.753), stroke (0.688), and mortality (0.719). The prediction tool was    superior to the Framingham model at predicting CHD and was at least as    accurate as the UKPDS model at predicting stroke.    Conclusions. We created an accurate tool for predicting the risk of    stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and death in patients    with type 2 diabetes.

Evidence from both the    laboratory and large scale clinical trials has revealed that diabetic    complications progress unimpeded via the phenomenon of metabolic memory    even when glycemic control is pharmaceutically achieved. Gene expression    can be stably altered through epigenetic changes which not only allow    cells and organisms to quickly respond to changing environmental stimuli    but also confer the ability of the cell to ``memorize{''} these    encounters once the stimulus is removed. As such, the roles that these    mechanisms play in the metabolic memory phenomenon are currently being    examined.    We have recently reported the development of a zebrafish model of type I    diabetes mellitus and characterized this model to show that diabetic    zebrafish not only display the known secondary complications including    the changes associated with diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy    and impaired wound healing but also exhibit impaired caudal fin    regeneration. This model is unique in that the zebrafish is capable to    regenerate its damaged pancreas and restore a euglycemic state similar    to what would be expected in post-transplant human patients. Moreover,    multiple rounds of caudal fin amputation allow for the separation and    study of pure epigenetic effects in an in vivo system without potential    complicating factors from the previous diabetic state. Although    euglycemia is achieved following pancreatic regeneration, the diabetic    secondary complication of fin regeneration and skin wound healing    persists indefinitely. In the case of impaired fin regeneration, this    pathology is retained even after multiple rounds of fin regeneration in    the daughter fin tissues. These observations point to an underlying    epigenetic process existing in the metabolic memory state. Here we    present the methods needed to successfully generate the diabetic and    metabolic memory groups of fish and discuss the advantages of this    model.}"ISI:000209465100148,"Chamberlain, Catherine; Fredericks, Bronwyn; Davis, Bronwyn; Mein, Jacqueline; Smith, Catherine; Eades, Sandra & Oldenburg, Brian","Postpartum care for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus across urban, rural and remote locations: a protocol for a cohort linkage study",{SPRINGERPLUS},{2},,,,2013,,,,,,,,,"{Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, along    with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with Aboriginal and Torres    Strait Islander (Aboriginala) women in Australia particularly affected.    GDM causes serious complications in pregnancy, birth, and the longer    term, for women and their infants. Women with GDM have an eightfold risk    of developing T2DM after pregnancy, compared to women without GDM.    Indigenous women have an even higher risk, at a younger age, and    progress more quickly from GDM to T2DM, compared to non-Indigenous    women. If left undetected and untreated, T2DM increases risks in    subsequent pregnancies, and can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney    failure, limb amputations and blindness for the woman in the longer    term. A GDM diagnosis offers a `window of opportunity' to provide    acceptable and effective prevention, treatment, and postpartum care. Low    rates of postpartum T2DM screening are reported among non-Aboriginal    women in Australia and Indigenous women in other countries, however,    data for Aboriginal women in Australia are scarce. A healthy diet,    exercise and breastfeeding can delay the onset of T2DM, and together    with T2DM screening are recommended elements of postpartum care for    women with GDM. This paper describes methods for a study evaluating    postpartum care among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women with GDM.    Methods/Design: This retrospective cohort includes all women who gave    birth at Cairns Hospital in far north Queensland, Australia, from 2004    to 2010, coded as having GDM in the Cairns Hospital Clinical Coding    system.

Hospital medical records    are being reviewed to validate accuracy of GDM case ascertainment, and    gather information on breastfeeding and provision of dietary advice.    Survival analysis is being used to estimate time to screening, and rates    of progression from GDM to T2DM. Logistic regression is being used to    compare postpartum care between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women, and    assess factors that may be associated with provision of postpartum care.

We defined and evaluated three    major categories for each site: usability, content, and reliability.    Usability was defined by design, ease of navigation, interactivity, and    internal search capability. Content was based on the quality of general    information about diabetes, discussions about monitoring blood glucose,    meat planning, exercise, complications, medications, alternative    therapies, resources, and support systems. Reliability was defined by    the presence of the HON code, identification of an author, and the    availability of experts. Results: The focused Mendosa search produced 47    web sites. The majority were published by commercial organizations. Five    sites were found to have the best usability.

However, if we take into account that, in general, activated    macrophages produce harmful cytokines only when engulfing necrotic (but    not apoptotic) cells, then the revised model becomes qualitatively and    quantitatively reasonable. Further, we show that known differences    between NOD and Balb/c mouse macrophage kinetics are large enough to    account for the fact that an apoptotic wave can trigger escalating    inflammatory response in NOD, but not Balb/c mice.

Nutritional support regimes with high glucose    content further exacerbate the problem. Tight glucose control has been    shown to reduce mortality by up to 43\% if levels are kept below 6.1    mmol/L. This research develops a control algorithm with insulin and    nutritional inputs for targeted glucose control in the critically ill.    Ethics approval for this research was granted by the Canterbury Ethics    Committee. Proof-of-concept clinical pilot trials were conducted on    intubated, insulin-dependent Christchurch ICU patients (n=7) on constant    nutritional support. A target 10-15\% reduction in glucose level per    hour for a desired glucose level of 4-6 mmol/L was set. 43\% and 91 \%    of glucose targets were achieved within +/- 5 and +/- 20\%,    respectively. The mean error was 8.9\% (0.5 mmol/L), with an absolute    range {[}0, 2.9] mmol/L. End glucose levels were 40\% lower compared to    initial values. All large target errors are attributable to sudden    changes in patient physiology at low glucose values, rather than    systemic deficiencies. Target errors are consistent with and explainable    by published sensor error distributions. The results show that intensive    model-based glucose management with nutrition control reduced absolute    glucose levels progressively while reducing the severity of glycaemic    fluctuation even with significant inter-patient variability and    time-varying physiological condition. Trials spanning longer periods of    time are in development to verify the short-term pilot studies performed    and to test the adaptability of the controller. Clinically, these    results indicate potential in clinical use to reduce ICU mortality as    well as reduce risk of severe complications. (c) 2005 IPEM. Published by    Elsevier Ltd.

In the non-obese diabetic (NOD)    mouse model, CD8(+) T cells play an essential role in both the initial    triggering of insulitis and its destructive phase, and proinsulin (PI)    is one of the dominant target antigens (Ags). However, little is known    about the beta cell epitopes presented by HLA class I molecules and    recognized by human CD8+ T cells. We and other groups recently applied    reverse immunology approaches to identify HLA class I-restricted PI    epitopes. To establish an inventory of potential naturally processed    epitopes, whole human PI or the transitional region between the B-chain    and C-peptide were digested with purified proteasome complexes. By    combining proteasome digestion data with epitope prediction algorithms,    candidate epitopes restricted by HLA-A2.1 and other HLA class I    molecules were identified. We validated immunogenicity and natural    processing of the identified PI epitopes in HLA-A2.1-transgenic mice,    while others demonstrated recognition of multiple PI epitopes by CD8+ T    cells from T1DM and healthy subjects in the context of different HLA    class I molecules. These results demonstrate the power of reverse    immunology strategies for epitope discovery. DNA vaccination of    HLA-transgenic mice may be another rapid and efficient reverse    immunology approach to map additional epitopes derived from other T1DM    Ags, such as IA-2 and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD 65). Transfer    of this information to Elispot- and MHC tetramer-based assay formats    should allow to reliably detect and characterize autoreactive CD8+ T    cell responses in T1DM, and may open new avenues for early T1DM    diagnosis and immune intervention.}"ISI:000243126100046,"Rassi, Diane M.; Junta, Cristina M.; Fachin, Ana L.; Sandrin-Garcia, Paula; Mello, Stephano S.; Fernandes, Ana P.

Methods. The plantar soft tissues under the metatarsal heads in each    left foot of 13 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and eight    age-matched healthy subjects were measured with a loading-unloading    device. The system comprised a 5-12 MHz linear-array ultrasound    transducer and a load cell that operated at an impact velocity of about    5 cm/s. The stress-strain plot was derived by simultaneously recording    the stress response and tissue deformation during a loading-unloading    cycle. The energy dissipation ratio in all subjects could then be    analyzed.    Findings. Although only the plantar soft tissue under the fourth    metatarsal head in the diabetic patients endured significantly greater    energy (P = 0.035) than the healthy subjects, a trend of an increased    energy dissipation ratio for the metatarsals in the diabetic patients    was observed.    Interpretation. The plantar soft tissue under the metatarsal head in the    diabetic patients endures high dissipated energy during a simulating    walking status in the study. The increased dissipated energy in the    tissue may be responsible for the tissue breakdown in the diabetic    patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Likewise, among siblings without MI, the QT/RR slope    was steeper in diabetics than in nondiabetics (0.104 +/- 0.053 vs 0.080    +/- 0.042; P = 0.008). The association of DM with steeper QT/RR slope    remained significant in multivariate models in post-MI patients (beta:    -0.14; P = 0.004) as well as in individuals without MI (beta -0.10; P =    0.047).    Conclusions: In a large population of survivors of MI and unaffected    siblings, patients and siblings presenting with DM exhibited an abnormal    QT rate-dependence, compared with individuals without DM in both groups.    Thus, diabetes itself maybe a major determinant of ventricular    arrhythmias, independently of a previous MI. These observations might in    part explain the higher incidence of sudden cardiac death and    ventricular arrhythmias in patients with DM.}"ISI:000244341200041,"Sladek, Robert; Rocheleau, Ghislain; Rung, Johan; Dina, Christian; Shen, Lishuang; Serre, David; Boutin, Philippe; Vincent, Daniel; Belisle, Alexandre; Hadjadj, Samy; Balkau, Beverley; Heude, Barbara; Charpentier, Guillaume; Hudson, Thomas J.; Montpetit, Alexandre; Pshezhetsky, Alexey V.; Prentki, Marc; Posner, Barry I.; Balding, David J.; Meyre, David; Polychronakos, Constantin & Froguel, Philippe",A genome-wide association study identifies novel risk loci for type 2 diabetes,{NATURE},{445},{7130},{FEB 22},{881-885},2007,,,,,,,,,"{Type 2 diabetes mellitus results from the interaction of environmental    factors with a combination of genetic variants, most of which were    hitherto unknown.

There were three follow-up visits during the    study period. We collected laboratory test results of the two groups    through each of the following visits and analyzed them using ANCOVA. We    discovered a significant difference in fasting blood glucose levels    between intervention and control group as early as the first follow-up.    At the second follow-up, both fasting blood glucose and HBAlc levels    were significantly different between intervention and control group. At    the third follow-up, there was a significant difference in fasting blood    glucose, HBA1c, and total cholesterol between intervention and control    group. We also monitored the number of logins for the patients in the    intervention group during the follow-up period. The result showed the    patients had consistently logged into the POEM system (about 8.5 +/- 3.7    logins per person per month after 3 months enrollment). Thus, the    patients in the intervention group had better control of their fasting    blood glucose, HbAlc and total cholesterol levels than those in the    control group due to the assistance of the system.

While LS-SVM obtained 78.21\%    classification accuracy using 10-fold cross validation, the proposed    system called GDA-LS-SVM obtained 82.05\% classification accuracy using    10-fold cross validation. The robustness of the proposed system is    examined using classification accuracy, k-fold cross-validation method    and confusion matrix. The obtained classification accuracy is 82.05\%    and it is very promising compared to the previously reported    classification techniques. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

How accurate can trained clinicians predict blood glucose    concentrations? Good clinical treatment is, among other things, related    to understanding the factors influencing blood glucose level. We analyze    trained clinician's prediction accuracy in comparison with selected    computer-implemented prediction algorithms and models.    Methods: We have in this study included diaries of 12 people with type 1    diabetes. This test group consists of seven males and five females, ages    24 to 60, HbA(1c) 6.0 to 8.9 and a BMI between 20 and 28 kg/m(2). Eight    experienced clinicians tried to predict the blood glucose measurements    based on minimum three days of diary history. Selected prediction    algorithms and models were used for comparison. The reason we focus on    type I diabetes is that it has the most critical insulin requirement, so    accurate prediction can be more critical than for type 2.    Results: An accuracy of 28.5\% and an error of 26.7\% were found from    predictions made by the clinicians. A physiological model and an    artificial intelligence model showed higher accuracy of 32.2\% and    34.2\% in comparison with the clinicians (p < 0.05). A simple predictor    algorithm based on the mean blood glucose history showed significant (p    < 0.05) lower total root mean square error compared to predictions made    by the clinicians.    Conclusion: To predict blood glucose level from diaries has shown to be    profoundly difficult even for experienced clinicians in comparison with    predictions from computer algorithms and models. This suggests that    computer-based systems incorporating predicting algorithms and models    are likely to contribute positively to the day-to-day treatment of    people with diabetes.}"ISI:000250338500097,"Koleszynska, Joanna",GIGISim - The intelligent telehealth system: Computer aided diabetes management - A new review,,{4692},{1},,{789-796},2007,,"{11th International Conference on Knowledge-Based Intelligent Informational and Engineering Systems/17th Italian Workshop on Neural Networks, Vietri sul Mare, ITALY, SEP 12-14, 2007}",,"{Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems: KES 2007 - WIRN 2007, Pt I, Proceedings}",,,{LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},"Apolloni, B; Howlett, RJ & Jain, L","{The projected epidemic of diabetes will emerge as a major threat to the    public health.

Taking    diabetes mellitus as a paradigm, we have sought to overcome these    limitations by ex vivo electrotransfer of a nonviral insulin expression    vector into primary hepatocytes followed by immediate autologous    reimplantation in a preclinical model of diabetes.    Methods and Results: In a single 3-hour procedure, hepatocytes were    isolated from a surgically resected liver wedge, electroporated with an    insulin expression plasmid ex vivo and reimplanted intraparenchymally    under ultrasonic guidance into the liver in each of 10    streptozotocin-induced diabetic Yorkshire pigs. The vector was comprised    of a bifunctional, glucose-responsive promoter linked to human insulin    cDNA. Ambient glucose concentrations appropriately altered human insulin    mRNA expression and C-peptide secretion within minutes in vitro and in    vivo. Treated swine showed correction of hyperglycemia, glucose    intolerance, dyslipidemia and other metabolic abnormalities for >= 47    weeks. Metabolic correction correlated significantly with the number of    hepatocytes implanted. Importantly, we observed no hypoglycemia even    under fasting conditions. Direct intrahepatic implantation of    hepatocytes did not alter biochemical indices of liver function or    induce abnormal hepatic lobular architecture. About 70\% of implanted    hepatocytes functionally engrafted, appeared histologically normal,    retained vector DNA and expressed human insulin for >= 47 weeks. Based    on structural tissue analyses and transcriptome data, we showed that    early correction of diabetes attenuated and even prevented pathological    changes in the eye, kidney, liver and aorta.    Conclusions: We demonstrate that autologous hepatocytes can be    efficiently, simply and safely modified by electroporation of a nonviral    vector to express, process and secrete insulin durably.

Metformin is an oral hypoglycaemic agent that improves insulin action in    patients with type-2 diabetes. We investigated the effect of a one-year    treatment with metformin versus placebo in patients with T1DM and    persistent poor glycaemic control.    Methodology/Principal Findings: One hundred patients with T1DM,    preserved hypoglycaemic awareness and HaemoglobinA(1c) (HbA(1c)) >=    8.5\% during the year before enrolment entered a one-month run-in on    placebo treatment. Thereafter, patients were randomized (baseline) to    treatment with either metformin (1 g twice daily) or placebo for 12    months (double-masked). Patients continued ongoing insulin therapy and    their usual outpatient clinical care. The primary outcome measure was    change in HbA(1c) after one year of treatment.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty obese T2DM and 60 non-diabetic    women closely matched by age, body mass index, waist circumference, and    smoking status were recruited from the outpatient Obesity Unit of a    university hospital. The exclusion criteria included chronic respiratory    disease, smoking habit, neuromuscular and cerebrovascular disease,    alcohol abuse, use of sedatives, and pregnancy. Examinations included a    non-attended respiratory polygraphy, pulmonary function testing, and an    awake arterial gasometry. Oxygen saturation measures included the    percentage of time spent at saturations below 90\% (CT90). A high    prevalence of SAHS was found in both groups (T2DM: 80\%, nondiabetic:    78.3\%). No differences in the number of sleep apnea-hypopnea events    between diabetic and non-diabetic patients were observed. However, in    diabetic patients, a significantly increase in the CT90 was detected    (20.2 +/- 30.2\% vs. 6.8 +/- 13,5\%; p = 0.027). In addition, residual    volume (RV) was significantly higher in T2DM (percentage of predicted:    79.7 +/- 18.1 vs. 100.1 +/- 22.8; p<0.001). Multiple linear regression    analyses showed that T2DM but not RV was independently associated with    CT90.    Conclusions/Significance: T2DM adversely affects breathing during sleep,    becoming an independent risk factor for severe nocturnal hypoxemia in    obese patients. Given that SAHS is a risk factor of cardiovascular    disease, the screening for SAHS in T2DM patients seems mandatory.}"ISI:000265500700019,"Kotnik, Katarina; Popova, Elena; Todiras, Mihail; Mori, Marcelo A.; Alenina, Natalia; Seibler, Jost & Bader, Michael",Inducible Transgenic Rat Model for Diabetes Mellitus Based on shRNA-Mediated Gene Knockdown,{PLOS ONE},{4},{4},{APR 2},,2009,,,,,,,,,"{The rat is an important animal model in biomedical research, but gene    targeting technology is not established for this species.

The aim of the present study was to    examine whether the lifestyle intervention had an effect on the ten-year    mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in the DPS participants    originally randomized either into an intervention or control group.    Furthermore, we compared these results with a population-based cohort    comprising individuals of varying glucose tolerance states.    Methods and Findings: Middle-aged, overweight people with IGT (n=522)    were randomized into intensive intervention (including physical    activity, weight reduction and dietary counseling), or control    ``mini-intervention{''} group. Median length of the intervention period    was 4 years and the mean follow-up was 10.6 years. The population-based    reference study cohort included 1881 individuals (1570 with normal    glucose tolerance, 183 with IGT, 59 with screen-detected type 2    diabetes, 69 with previously known type 2 diabetes) with the mean    follow-up of 13.8 years. Mortality and cardiovascular morbidity data    were collected from the national Hospital Discharge Register and Causes    of Death Register. Among the DPS participants who consented for register    linkage (n=505), total mortality (2.2 vs. 3.8 per 1000 person years,    hazard ratio HR=0.57, 95\% CI 0.21-1.58) and cardiovascular morbidity    (22.9 vs. 22.0 per 1000 person years, HR=1.04, 95\% CI 0.72-1.51) did    not differ significantly between the intervention and control groups.    Compared with the population-based cohort with impaired glucose    tolerance, adjusted HRs were 0.21 (95\% CI 0.09-0.52) and 0.39 (95\% CI    0.20-0.79) for total mortality, and 0.89 (95\% CI 0.62-1.27) and 0.87    (0.60-1.27) for cardiovascular morbidity in the intervention and control    groups of the DPS, respectively. The risk of death in DPS combined    cohort was markedly lower than in FINRISK IGT cohort (adjusted HR 0.30,    95\% CI 0.17-0.54), but there was no significant difference in the risk    of CVD (adjusted HR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.64-1.21).    Conclusions: Lifestyle intervention among persons with IGT did not    decrease cardiovascular morbidity during the first 10 years of    follow-up. However, the statistical power may not be sufficient to    detect small differences between the intervention and control groups.    Low total mortality among participants of the DPS compared with    individuals with IGT in the general population could be ascribed to a    lower cardiovascular risk profile at baseline and regular follow-up.}"ISI:000266432700046,"Hecht, Gil; Eventov-Friedman, Smadar; Rosen, Chava; Shezen, Elias; Tchorsh, Dalit; Aronovich, Anna; Freud, Enrique; Golan, Hana; El-Hasid, Ronit; Katchman, Helena; Hering, Bernhard J.; Zung, Amnon; Kra-Oz, Zipi; Shaked-Mishan, Pninit; Yusim, Alex; Shtabsky, Alex; Idelevitch, Pavel; Tobar, Ana; Harmelin, Alon; Bachar-Lustig, Esther & Reisner, Yair",Embryonic pig pancreatic tissue for the treatment of diabetes in a nonhuman primate model,{PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA},{106},{21},{MAY 26},{8659-8664},2009,,,,,,,,,"{Xenotransplantation of pig tissues has great potential to overcome the    shortage of organ donors. One approach to address the vigorous immune    rejection associated with xenotransplants is the use of embryonic    precursor tissue, which induces and utilizes host vasculature upon its    growth and development. Recently, we showed in mice that embryonic pig    pancreatic tissue from embryonic day 42 (E42) exhibits optimal    properties as a beta cell replacement therapy. We now demonstrate the    proof of concept in 2 diabetic Cynomolgus monkeys, followed for 393 and    280 days, respectively. A marked reduction of exogenous insulin    requirement was noted by the fourth month after transplantation,    reaching complete independence from exogenous insulin during the fifth    month after transplantation, with full physiological control of blood    glucose levels. The porcine origin of insulin was documented by a    radioimmunoassay specific for porcine C-peptide. Furthermore, the    growing tissue was found to be predominantly vascularized with host    blood vessels, thereby evading hyperacute or acute rejection, which    could potentially be mediated by preexisting anti-pig antibodies.    Durable graft protection was achieved, and most of the late    complications could be attributed to the immunosuppressive protocol.    While fine tuning of immune suppression, tissue dose, and implantation    techniques are still required, our results demonstrate that porcine E-42    embryonic pancreatic tissue can normalize blood glucose levels in    primates. Its long-term proliferative capacity, its revascularization by    host endothelium, and its reduced immunogenicity, strongly suggest that    this approach could offer an attractive replacement therapy for    diabetes.}"ISI:000267058000077,"Martinez-Sarriegui, Inaki; Zhu, Hong; Shan, Lijun; Garcia-Saez, Gema; Gomez, Enrique J. & Elena Hernando, M.",MODELLING AND FORMAL SPECIFICATION OF A MULTIAGENT TELEMEDICINE SYSTEM FOR DIABETES CARE,,,,,{507-512},2009,,"{1st International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, Inst Syst \& Technol Informat, Control \& Commun, Porto, PORTUGAL, JAN 19-21, 2009}",,{ICAART 2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AGENTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},,,,"Fred, A","{This paper presents the modelling and formal specification of a    telemedicine system for diabetes care.

The oral agent pioglitazone is licensed for use with insulin when    metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated. This systematic review    and meta-analysis investigates the extent to which adding pioglitazone    to insulin-containing regimens produces benefits in terms of    patient-relevant outcomes.    Methodology/Principal Findings: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane    Library were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing    pioglitazone in combination with any insulin-containing regimen in    comparison with the same insulin regimen alone in patients with type 2    diabetes. Outcomes investigated included HbA1c, hypoglycaemia, weight,    and adverse events. Studies were selected, assessed and summarised    according to standard systematic review methodology and in a    meta-analysis. We included eight trials that examined the benefits of    adding pioglitazone to an insulin regimen and studied a total of 3092    patients with type 2 diabetes. All studies included patients with    previously inadequate glucose control. Trial duration was between 12    weeks and 34.5 months. The trials used pioglitazone doses of up to 45    mg/day. In our meta-analysis, the mean reduction in HbA1c was 0.58\%    (95\% CI: -0.70, -0.46, p<0.00001). Hypoglycaemic episodes were slightly    more frequent in the pioglitazone arms ( relative risk 1.27; 95\% CI:    0.99, 1.63, p = 0.06). Where reported, HDL-cholesterol tended to be    increased with pioglitazone. Patients on pioglitazone tended to gain    more weight than those who were not, with an average difference of    almost 3 kg. Peripheral oedema was more frequent in the pioglitazone    groups. None of the studies reported on fractures in women, and data on    cardiovascular events were inconclusive, with most studies being too    short or too small to assess these long-term outcomes.    Conclusions/Significance: When added to insulin regimens, pioglitazone    confers a small advantage in terms of HbA1c in type 2 diabetes patients    with previous inadequate glucose control, but at the cost of increased    hypoglycaemia and weight gain.

However, following intravenous and oral administration    of glucose serum insulin release was increased in individuals with the    C-allele (p=0.003 and p=0.01, respectively). A meta-analyse combining    clamp and IVGTT data from a total of 905 non-diabetic individuals showed    that the C-risk allele associated with decreased insulin sensitivity    (p=0.003) and increased insulin release (p=0.002). The major T-allele of    the intronic JAZF1 rs864745 conferring increased diabetes risk was    associated with increased 2(nd) phase serum insulin release during an    IVGTT (p=0.03), and an increased fasting serum insulin level (p=0.001).    The remaining variants did not show any associations with insulin    response, insulin sensitivity or any other measured quantitative traits.    Conclusion: The present studies suggest that the diabetogenic impact of    the C-allele of rs4607103 near ADAMTS9 may in part be mediated through    decreased insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues.}"ISI:000270624600025,"Li, Jialiang; Xia, Yingcun; Palta, Mari & Shankar, Anoop",Impact of unknown covariance structures in semiparametric models for longitudinal data: An application to Wisconsin diabetes data,{COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS \& DATA ANALYSIS},{53},{12},{OCT 1},{4186-4197},2009,,,,,,,,,"{Semiparametric models are becoming increasingly attractive for    longitudinal data analysis. often there is lack of knowledge of the    covariance structure of the response variable.

Here, we examined the effects    of experimental DM on a pre-existing tau pathology in the pR5 transgenic    mouse strain that is characterized by NFTs. pR5 mice express P301L    mutant human tau that is associated with dementia. Experimental DM was    induced by administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which causes insulin    deficiency. We determined phosphorylation of tau, using    immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Solubility of tau was    determined upon extraction with sarkosyl and formic acid, and Gallyas    silver staining was employed to reveal NFTs. Insulin depletion by STZ    administration in six months-old non-transgenic mice causes increased    tau phosphorylation, without its deposition or NFT formation. In    contrast, in pR5 mice this results in massive deposition of    hyperphosphorylated, insoluble tau. Furthermore, they develop a    pronounced tau-histopathology, including NFTs at this early age, while    the pathology in sham-treated pR5 mice is moderate. Whereas experimental    DM did not result in deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau in    non-transgenic mice, a predisposition to develop a tau pathology in    young pR5 mice was both sufficient and necessary to exacerbate tau    deposition and NFT formation.

However, GIP also promotes lipogenesis, thus potentially restricting its    therapeutic use. The current studies evaluated the effects of a    truncated GIP analog, D-Ala(2)-GIP(1-30) (D-GIP(1-30)), on glucose    homeostasis and beta-cell mass in rat models of diabetes.    Materials and Methods: The insulinotropic and pro-survival potency of    D-GIP(1-30) was evaluated in perfused pancreas preparations and cultured    INS-1 beta-cells, respectively, and receptor selectivity evaluated using    wild type and GIP receptor knockout mice. Effects of D-GIP(1-30) on    beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis, in vivo, were determined    using Lean Zucker rats, obese Vancouver diabetic fatty rats,    streptozotocin treated rats, and obese Zucker diabetic fatty rats, with    effects on beta-cell mass determined in histological studies of    pancreatic tissue. Lipogenic effects of D-GIP(1-30) were evaluated on    cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes.    Results: Acutely, D-GIP(1-30) improved glucose tolerance and insulin    secretion. Chronic treatment with D-GIP(1-30) reduced levels of islet    pro-apoptotic proteins in Vancouver diabetic fatty rats and preserved    beta-cell mass in streptozotocin treated rats and Zucker diabetic fatty    rats, resulting in improved insulin responses and glycemic control in    each animal model, with no change in body weight. In in vitro studies,    D-GIP(1-30) exhibited equivalent potency to GIP(1-42) on beta-cell    function and survival, but greatly reduced action on lipoprotein lipase    activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Properly accounting for the saturation of insulin action    and reducing the need for frequent measurements are important aspects in    intensive insulin therapy. This paper presents a composite metabolic    model, `Glucosafe', that integrates models and parameters from normal    physiology and accounts for the reduced rate of glucose gut absorption    and saturation of insulin action in patients with reduced insulin    sensitivity. Particularly, two different sites of reduced insulin    sensitivity, before and after the non-linearity of insulin action, are    explored with this model. These approaches are assessed based on the    model's accuracy in retrospectively predicting blood glucose    measurements of 10 randomly chosen, hyperglycemic intensive care    patients. For each patient, median absolute percent error is <25\% for    prediction times <= 270 min and modelling reduced insulin sensitivity    after the non-linearity, compared to <29\% for modelling reduced insulin    sensitivity before the non-linearity. Scaling the insulin effect (after    the non-linearity) is a suitable assumption in this model structure.    These results are preliminary and subject to further and more extensive    validation of the model's capability to predict the longer term (>2 h)    blood glucose excursion in critically ill patients.

Early detection is essential to enable appropriate    interventional therapy and management. Dynamic pupillometry has been    proposed as a simpler and more sensitive tool to detect subclinical    autonomic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate pupil    responsiveness in diabetic subjects with and without cardiovascular    autonomic neuropathy (CAN) using dynamic pupillometry in two sets of    experiments.    Methods: During the first experiment, one flash was administered and the    pupil response was recorded for 3 s. In the second experiment, 25    flashes at 1-s interval were administered and the pupil response was    recorded for 30 s. Several time and pupil-iris radius-related parameters    were computed from the acquired data. A total of 24 diabetic subjects    (16 without and 8 with CAN) and 16 healthy volunteers took part in the    study.    Results: Our results show that diabetic subjects with and without CAN    have sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, evidenced by    diminished amplitude reflexes and significant smaller pupil radius. It    suggests that pupillary autonomic dysfunction occurs before a more    generalized involvement of the autonomic nervous system, and this could    be used to detect early autonomic dysfunction.    Conclusions: Dynamic pupillometry provides a simple, inexpensive, and    noninvasive tool to screen high-risk diabetic patients for diabetic    autonomic neuropathy.}"ISI:000280243300005,"Bi, Mark; Kao, Wen Hong Linda; Boerwinkle, Eric; Hoogeveen, Ron C.; Rasmussen-Torvik, Laura J.; Astor, Brad C.; North, Kari E.; Coresh, Josef & Koettgen, Anna",Association of rs780094 in GCKR with Metabolic Traits and Incident Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: The ARIC Study,{PLOS ONE},{5},{7},{JUL 22},,2010,,,,,,,,,"{Objective: The minor T-allele of rs780094 in the glucokinase regulator    gene (GCKR) associates with a number of metabolic traits including    higher triglyceride levels and improved glycemic regulation in study    populations of mostly European ancestry.

Maintaining    tight glycemic control is essential to prevent microvascular and    macrovascular complications as demonstrated by many studies. Current    recommendation for HbAlc is less then 7\% and even 6.5\% in special    individuals. HbAlc measurement is considered the gold standard of    diabetes care and serves as a surrogate of diabetes-related    complications, but it does not provide information about glycemic    excursions. For these reasons, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)    levels is considered an important adjunct to HbAlc measurements for    achieving and maintaining glycemic control and consequently for reducing    diabetes-related complications. A new method that offers us a complete    investigation of glucose excursions is continuous glucose monitoring    system (CGMS) that measure glucose concentration in subcutaneous    interstitial fluid which can reflect changes in blood glucose    concentrations reasonably quickly every 5 min throughout 72 hours (3    days).    The aim of this paper was to evaluate the different methods of assessing    glucose control in individuals with diabetes mellitus and to compare    themselves in order to establish the clinical relevance. We assessed the    glycemic control by HbA1c, SMBG and CGMS Gold simultaneously in a number    of 97 individuals with diabetes. 20 individuals have a HbAlc between 6,5    - 7,4\%, 33 patients between 7,5 - 8,4\%, 15 between 8,5-9,4\%, 10    between 9,5 - 10,5\% and 7 persons more than 10,5\%. It was observed    that between HbAlc level and the period spent in glycemic values more    than 180 mg/di there is not a direct relationship as we expected. The    same trend was observed in near normal glycemic status but in different    way.    Assessing of glycemia in diabetes is crucially important to the    prevention of both acute and long - term complications.

These patients face    life-long risks for blindness, cardiovascular and renal diseases, and    complications of insulin treatment. New therapies that protect islets    from autoimmune destruction and allow continuing insulin production are    needed. Increasing evidence regarding the pathomechanism of T1D    indicates that islets are destroyed by the relentless attack by    autoreactive immune cells evolving from an aberrant action of the    innate, in addition to adaptive, immune system that produces islet-toxic    cytokines, chemokines, and other effectors of islet inflammation. We    tested the hypothesis that targeting nuclear import of stress-responsive    transcription factors evoked by agonist-stimulated innate and adaptive    immunity receptors would protect islets from autoimmune destruction.    Principal Findings: Here we show that a first-in-class inhibitor of    nuclear import, cSN50 peptide, affords in vivo islet protection    following a 2-day course of intense treatment in NOD mice, which    resulted in a diabetes-free state for one year without apparent    toxicity. This nuclear import inhibitor precipitously reduces the    accumulation of islet-destructive autoreactive lymphocytes while    enhancing activation-induced cell death of T and B lymphocytes derived    from autoimmune diabetes-prone, non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice that    develop T1D. Moreover, in this widely used model of human T1D we noted    attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in    immune cells.    Conclusions: These results indicate that a novel form of immunotherapy    that targets nuclear import can arrest inflammation-driven destruction    of insulin-producing beta cells at the site of autoimmune attack within    pancreatic islets during the progression of T1D.}"ISI:000283045300009,"Gkrania-Klotsas, Effrossyni; Ye, Zheng; Cooper, Andrew J.; Sharp, Stephen J.; Luben, Robert; Biggs, Mary L.; Chen, Liang-Kung; Gokulakrishnan, Kuppan; Hanefeld, Markolf; Ingelsson, Erik; Lai, Wen-An; Lin, Shih-Yi; Lind, Lars; Lohsoonthorn, Vitool; Mohan, Viswanathan; Muscari, Antonio; Nilsson, Goran; Ohrvik, John; Qiang, Jiang Chao; Jenny, Nancy Swords; Tamakoshi, Koji; Temelkova-Kurktschiev, Theodora; Wang, Ya-Yu; Yajnik, Chittaranjan Sakerlal; Zoli, Marco; Khaw, Kay-Tee; Forouhi, Nita G.; Wareham, Nicholas J. & Langenberg, Claudia",Differential White Blood Cell Count and Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cross-Sectional and Prospective Studies,{PLOS ONE},{5},{10},{OCT 18},,2010,,,,,,,,,"{Objective: Biological evidence suggests that inflammation might induce    type 2 diabetes (T2D), and epidemiological studies have shown an    association between higher white blood cell count (WBC) and T2D.

Depression, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary    disease, dementia, and Parkinson's disease were individually associated    with a decreased likelihood of therapeutic progression. Age, residential    status, number of hospitalisations and adherence to anti-diabetic    medicines delayed therapeutic progression.    Conclusions/Significance: Increasing numbers of unrelated conditions    decreased the likelihood of therapeutic progression in veterans with    diabetes.

Such information would be useful for ``dosing{''} daily steps in    clinical practice. This study aimed to quantify decrements in blood    pressure and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) per 1,000 daily step increments.    Methodology/Principal Findings: Two hundred and one subjects with type 2    diabetes underwent assessments of step counts (pedometer-measured),    blood pressure, A1C and anthropometric parameters. Due to missing data,    the final analysis was conducted on 83 women and 102 men, with a mean    age of 60 years. Associations of daily steps with blood pressure and A1C    were evaluated using sex-specific multivariate linear regression models    (adjusted for age, ethnicity, and BMI). Potential sex differences were    confirmed in a combined model (women and men) with interaction terms.    Mean values for daily steps, blood pressure, A1C and BMI were 5,357    steps/day; 137/80 mm Hg; 7.7\% and 30.4 kg/m(2) respectively.

However, no such method has fully    validated the independence of virtual patients (or resulting clinical    trial predictions) from the data used to create them. This study uses    matched cohorts from a TGC clinical trial to validate virtual patients    and in-silico virtual trial models and methods.    Methods: Data from a 211 patient subset of the Glucontrol trial in    Liege, Belgium. Glucontrol-A (N = 142) targeted 4.4-6.1 mmol/L and    Glucontrol-B (N = 69) targeted 7.8-10.0 mmol/L. Cohorts were matched by    APACHE II score, initial BG, age, weight, BMI and sex (p > 0.25).    Virtual patients are created by fitting a clinically validated model to    clinical data, yielding time varying insulin sensitivity profiles    (SI(t)) that drives in-silico patients.    Model fit and intra-patient (forward) prediction errors are used to    validate individual in-silico virtual patients. Self-validation (tests A    protocol on Group-A virtual patients; and B protocol on B virtual    patients) and cross-validation (tests A protocol on Group-B virtual    patients; and B protocol on A virtual patients) are used in comparison    to clinical data to assess ability to predict clinical trial results.    Results: Model fit errors were small (<0.25\%) for all patients,    indicating model fitness. Median forward prediction errors were: 4.3,    2.8 and 3.5\% for Group-A, Group-B and Overall (A+B), indicating    individual virtual patients were accurate representations of real    patients. SI and its variability were similar between cohorts indicating    they were metabolically similar.    Self and cross validation results were within 1-10\% of the clinical    data for both Group-A and Group-B. Self-validation indicated clinically    insignificant errors due to model and/or clinical compliance.    Cross-validation clearly showed that virtual patients enabled by    identified patient-specific SI(t) profiles can accurately predict the    performance of independent and different TGC protocols.    Conclusions: This study fully validates these virtual patients and in    silico virtual trial methods, and clearly shows they can accurately    simulate, in advance, the clinical results of a TGC protocol, enabling    rapid in silico protocol design and optimization.

It is widely pointed that the classical ontologies    cannot sufficiently handle imprecise and vague knowledge for some real    world applications, but fuzzy ontology can effectively resolve data and    knowledge problems with uncertainty. This paper presents a novel fuzzy    expert system for diabetes decision support application. A five-layer    fuzzy ontology, including a fuzzy knowledge layer, fuzzy group relation    layer, fuzzy group domain layer, fuzzy personal relation layer, and    fuzzy personal domain layer, is developed in the fuzzy expert system to    describe knowledge with uncertainty. By applying the novel fuzzy    ontology to the diabetes domain, the structure of the fuzzy diabetes    ontology (FDO) is defined to model the diabetes knowledge. Additionally,    a semantic decision support agent (SDSA), including a knowledge    construction mechanism, fuzzy ontology generating mechanism, and    semantic fuzzy decision making mechanism, is also developed. The    knowledge construction mechanism constructs the fuzzy concepts and    relations based on the structure of the FDO. The instances of the FDO    are generated by the fuzzy ontology generating mechanism. Finally, based    on the FDO and the fuzzy ontology, the semantic fuzzy decision making    mechanism simulates the semantic description of medical staff for    diabetes-related application.

Results show that the prepared MS was in the appropriate size    range for inhalation and contained many surfaces and internal pores    meaning low aerodynamic density. Ex4-C(16) was more efficiently adsorbed    onto porous PLGA MSs than native exendin-4, and an approximately 5\%    loading of Ex4-C(16) onto this porous MS (RG504H) was achieved. This    optimized porous MS was found to be efficiently deposited throughout the    entire lungs of mice including alveoli region. Furthermore, this porous    MS adsorbed with Ex4-C(16) (approx. 100 mu g/mouse) displayed much    protracted hypoglycemic efficacy in non-fasted type 2 diabetic db/db    mice. Porous PLGA MS with adsorbed Ex4-C(16) showed the dual-advantages    of (i) sustained release and acceptable drug-loading due to strong    hydrophobic interaction and (ii) longer in vivo pulmonary hypoglycemic    duration due to albumin-binding by the palmityl group.

Mortality rates of diabetes and HIV/AIDS are similar. Diabetes    shares several common factors with HIV/AIDS and multidrug-resistant    tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The latter two health problems have been    efficiently managed by an open source electronic medical record system    (EMRS) in Latin America. Therefore a similar solution for diabetes in    SSA could be extremely helpful.    Objectives: The aim was to design and validate a conceptual model for an    EMRS to improve diabetes management in SSA making use of the HIV and TB    experience.    Methods: A review of the literature addressed diabetes care and    management in SSA as well as existing examples of information and    communication technology (ICT) use in SSA. Based on a need assessment    conducted in SSA a conceptual model based on the traditionally    structured healthcare system in SSA was mapped into a three-layer    structure. Application modules were derived and a demonstrator    programmed based on an open source EMRS. Then the approach was validated    by SSA experts.    Results: A conceptual model could be specified and validated which    enhances a problem-oriented approach to diabetes management processes.    The prototyp EMRS demonstrates options for a patient portal and    simulation tools for education of health professional and patients in    SSA.    Conclusion: It is possible to find IT solutions for diabetes care in SSA    which follow the same efficiency concepts as HIV or TB modules in Latin    America. The local efficiency and sustainability of the solution will,    however, depend on training and changes in work behavior.}"ISI:000287219100002,"Karahoca, Adem; Karahoca, Dilek & Kara, Ali",Diagnosis of Diabetes by using Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems,,,,,{5-8},2010,,"{5th International Conference on Soft Computing, Computing with Words and Perceptions in System Analysis, Decision and Control, Famagusta, CYPRUS, SEP 02-04, 2009}",,"{2009 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFT COMPUTING, COMPUTING WITH WORDS AND PERCEPTIONS IN SYSTEM ANALYSIS, DECISION AND CONTROL}",,,,,"{Most of discoveries indicate that the best way to overcome diabetes is    to prevent the risks of diabetes before becoming a diabetic.

Recently, standard techniques of model-based design of    experiments (MBDoE) for parameter identification have been proposed to    design clinical tests for the identification of the model parameters for    a single type 1 diabetic individual. However, standard MBDoE is affected    by some limitations. In particular, the existence of a structural    mismatch between the responses of the subject and that of the model to    be identified, together with initial uncertainty in the model parameters    may lead to design clinical tests that are sub-optimal (scarcely    informative) or even unsafe (the actual response of the subject might be    hypoglycaemic or strongly hyperglycaemic). The integrated use of two    advanced MBDoE techniques (online model-based redesign of experiments    and backoff-based MBDoE) is proposed in this article as a way to    effectively tackle the above issue. Online model-based experiment    redesign is utilised to exploit the information embedded in the    experimental data as soon as the data become available, and to adjust    the clinical test accordingly whilst the test is running. Backoff-based    MBDoE explicitly accounts for model parameter uncertainty, and allows    one to plan a test that is both optimally informative and safe by    design. The effectiveness and features of the proposed approach are    assessed and critically discussed via a simulated case study based on    state-of-the-art detailed models of glucose homeostasis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs involved in many    fundamental biological processes. We aim to identify miRNAs that are    differentially-expressed in the pancreatic islets of the GK rats and    investigate both their short-and long term glucose-dependence during    glucose-stimulatory conditions.    Methodology/Principal Findings: Global profiling of 348 miRNAs in the    islets of GK rats and Wistar controls (females, 60 days, N = 6 for both    sets) using locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based microarrays allowed for the    clear separation of the two groups. Significant analysis of microarrays    (SAM) identified 30 differentially-expressed miRNAs, 24 of which are    predominantly upregulated in the GK rat islets. Monitoring of    qPCR-validated miRNAs during GSIS experiments on isolated islets showed    disparate expression trajectories between GK and controls indicating    distinct short-and long-term glucose dependence. We specifically found    expression of rno-miR-130a, rno-miR-132, rno-miR-212 and rno-miR-335 to    be regulated by hyperglycaemia. The putative targets of upregulated    miRNAs in the GK, filtered with glucose-regulated mRNAs, were found to    be enriched for insulin-secretion genes known to be downregulated in T2D    patients. Finally, the binding of rno-miR-335 to a fragment of the 3'UTR    of one of known down-regulated exocytotic genes in GK islets, Stxbp1 was    shown by luciferase assay.    Conclusions/Significance: The perturbed miRNA network found in the GK    rat islets is indicative of a system-wide impairment in the regulation    of genes important for the normal functions of pancreatic islets,    particularly in processes involving insulin secretion during glucose    stimulatory conditions. Our findings suggest that the reduced insulin    secretion observed in the GK rat may be partly due to upregulated miRNA    expression leading to decreased production of key proteins of the    insulin exocytotic machinery.}"ISI:000289531200012,"Lu, Pinyi; Bevan, David R.; Lewis, Stephanie N.; Hontecillas, Raquel & Bassaganya-Riera, Josep",Molecular modeling of lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein 2: a potential target for the discovery of novel type 2 diabetes prophylactics and therapeutics,{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING},{17},{3},{MAR},{543-553},2011,,,,,,,,,"{The rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are rising to epidemic proportions in    the US and worldwide.

Our    laboratory has discovered that abscisic acid (ABA) exerts anti-diabetic    effects, in part, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated    receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). However, since ABA does not bind to the    ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR gamma, the mechanism of activation    of PPAR gamma by ABA remains unknown.

In particular, novel autoantibodies, such as those against    IA-2 epitopes (aa1-577), had a predictive rate of 100\% in a 10-year    follow up (rapid progressors), unlike conventional autoantibodies that    required 15 years of follow up for a 74\% predictive rate (slow    progressors). The discrepancy between these two groups is thought to be    associated with T-cell avidity, including CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells.    For this purpose, we build a series of mathematical models incorporating    first one clone then multiple clones of islet-specific and pathogenic    CD8(+) and/or CD4(+) T cells, together with B lymphocytes, to    investigate the interaction of T-cell avidity with autoantibodies in    predicting disease onset. These models are instrumental in examining    several experimental observations associated with T-cell avidity,    including the phenomenon of avidity maturation (increased average T-cell    avidity over time), based on intra-and cross-clonal competition between    T cells in high-risk human subjects. The model shows that the level and    persistence of autoantibodies depends not only on the avidity of T    cells, but also on the killing efficacy of these cells. Quantification    and modeling of autoreactive T-cell avidities can thus determine the    level of risk associated with each type of autoantibodies and the timing    of T1D disease onset in individuals that have been tested positive for    these autoantibodies. Such studies may lead to early diagnosis of the    disease in high-risk individuals and thus potentially serve as a means    of staging patients for clinical trials of preventive or interventional    therapies far before disease onset.}"ISI:000290649500025,"Muthyala, Sudhakar; Raj, V.

For the tissue    engineering approach the cells were cultured on gelatin scaffolds    cross-linked with EDC in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone in vitro    (GPE scaffolds), while for the macroencapsulation approach the cells    were encapsulated in polyurethane-polyvinylpyrrolidone    semi-Interpenetrating networks. In the combination approach the cells    cultured on GPE scaffolds were further encapsulated in a    polyurethane-polyvinylpyrrolidone capsule. Real time PCR studies and the    glucose challenge assay have shown that cells on GPE scaffolds could    express and secrete insulin and glucagon in vitro. However, under in    vivo conditions the animals treated by the tissue engineering approach    died within 15-20 days and showed no reversal of their diabetes, due to    infiltration of immune cells such as CD4 and CD8 cells and macrophages.    In the macroencapsulation approach the animals showed euglycemia within    25 days, which was maintained for further 20 days, but after that the    animals died. Interestingly, in the combination approach the animals    showed reversal of hyperglycemia, and remained euglycemic for up to 3    months. The time needed to achieve initial euglycemia was different with    different cell types, i e. the combination approach with mouse Islets    achieved euglycemia within 15 days, whereas with PPC-derived islet-like    clusters euglycemia was achieved within 25 days This study confirmed    that a combination of tissue engineering and macroencapsulation with    mouse islets could reverse diabetes and maintain euglycemia in an    experimental diabetes rat model for 90 days.

For    men, however, the adjusted hazard ratio of insulin glargine use as    compared with intermediate/long-acting HI was 2.15 (95\% CI 1.01-4.59)    for pancreatic cancer, and 2.42 (95\% CI 1.50-8.40) for prostate cancer.    The increased risk was not observed among women.    Conclusions: Insulin glargine use did not increase the risk of overall    cancer incidence as compared with HI. The positive associations with    pancreatic and prostate cancer need further evaluation and validation.}"ISI:000292178600006,"Basciftci, Fatih & Hatay, Omer Faruk",Reduced-rule based expert system by the simplification of logic functions for the diagnosis of diabetes,{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},{41},{6},{JUN},{350-356},2011,,,,,,,,,"{Diabetes is a chronic and complex endocrine disease with metabolic    disorders caused by the imbalance between secreted and needed insulin    levels.

However, genomic understanding of T2D in Asians, especially Han Chinese,    is still limited.    Methods and Principal Findings: A two-stage GWAS was performed in Han    Chinese from Mainland China. The discovery stage included 793 T2D cases    and 806 healthy controls genotyped using Illumina Human 660- and    610-Quad BeadChips; and the replication stage included two independent    case-control populations (a total of 4445 T2D cases and 4458 controls)    genotyped using TaqMan assay.

This study investigates the effects of elevated plasma    glucose levels during diabetes on leukocyte recruitment and function in    established models of inflammation.    Methodology/Principal Findings: Diabetes was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by    intravenous alloxan (causing severe hyperglycemia), or by high fat diet    (moderate hyperglycemia). Leukocyte recruitment was studied in    anaesthetized mice using intravital microscopy of exposed cremaster    muscles, where numbers of rolling, adherent and emigrated leukocytes    were quantified before and during exposure to the inflammatory chemokine    MIP-2 (0.5 nM). During basal conditions, prior to addition of chemokine,    the adherent and emigrated leukocytes were increased in both alloxan-(62    +/- 18\% and 85 +/- 21\%, respectively) and high fat diet-induced (77    +/- 25\% and 86 +/- 17\%, respectively) diabetes compared to control    mice. MIP-2 induced leukocyte emigration in all groups, albeit    significantly more cells emigrated in alloxan-treated mice (15.3 +/-    1.0) compared to control (8.0 +/- 1.1) mice. Bacterial clearance was    followed for 10 days after subcutaneous injection of bioluminescent S.    aureus using non-invasive IVIS imaging, and the inflammatory response    was assessed by Myeloperoxidase-ELISA and confocal imaging. The    phagocytic ability of leukocytes was assessed using LPS-coated    fluorescent beads and flow cytometry. Despite efficient leukocyte    recruitment, alloxan-treated mice demonstrated an impaired ability to    clear bacterial infection, which we found correlated to a 50\% decreased    phagocytic ability of leukocytes in diabetic mice.    Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that reduced ability to    clear bacterial infections observed during experimentally induced    diabetes is not due to reduced leukocyte recruitment since sustained    hyperglycemia results in increased levels of adherent and emigrated    leukocytes in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Instead,    decreased phagocytic ability observed for leukocytes isolated from    diabetic mice might account for the impaired bacterial clearance.}"ISI:000293729900006,"Adolfsson, Eva Thors & Rosenblad, Andreas","Reporting systems, reporting rates and completeness of data reported from primary healthcare to a Swedish quality register - The National Diabetes Register",{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},{80},{9},{SEP},{663-668},2011,,,,,,,,,"{Objective: The aims of this paper were to study the reporting rate and    completeness of data reported from primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in    Sweden to the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR), with a special    attention on the relation between these measures and the reporting    system used by the PHCCs.    Method: A national survey conducted in Swedish primary healthcare    covering the year 2006. A questionnaire was used to collect data from    523 PHCCs. Data on 87,099 adult diabetic patients attending these PHCCs    and reported to the NDR were obtained from the register. In Sweden,    participation in the NDR is voluntary. The data were reported through    the Internet, either online using a web-based system or by direct    transmission. The main outcome measures were reporting rate and    completeness of reported data.    Results: Of the 523 PHCCs, almost two-thirds had reported <75\% of their    diabetic patients to the NDR. The lowest reporting rate was found among    the largest PHCCs, while the highest was found among small PHCCs (p <    0.001). Reasons given for not reporting data to the NDR were lack of    time and lack of personnel resources. Altogether, 73.1\% of the PHCCs    reported data to the NDR online using a web-based system, 20.5\% used    direct transmission and 6.3\% used both systems. The PHCCs that reported    data through direct transmission systems reported almost 70\% of their    diabetic patients to the NDR, while PHCCs using web-based systems    reported 54\% of their diabetic patients to the NDR. Adjusted for other    factors, using direct transmission increased the reporting rate by 13.0    percentage points. However, the web-based system contributed to a higher    completeness of data than the direct transmission system.    Conclusions: A direct transmission system facilitates a high reporting    rate to the register at the expense of lower completeness of the    reported data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: A case-control study was conducted in an urban population in    Tanzania among culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients and non-TB    neighbourhood controls. Participants were tested for diabetes according    to WHO guidelines and serum concentrations of acute phase reactants were    measured. The association between diabetes and TB, and the role of HIV    as an effect modifier, were examined using logistic regression. Since    blood glucose levels increase during the acute phase response, we    adjusted for elevated serum acute phase reactants.    Results: Among 803 cases and 350 controls the mean (SD) age was 34.8    (11.9) and 33.8 (12.0) years, and the prevalence of diabetes was 16.7\%    (95\% CI: 14.2; 19.4) and 9.4\% (6.6; 13.0), respectively.

Methodology: We conducted a cohort study in 2007-2008 using the GIANTT    (Groningen Initiative to Analyse type 2 diabetes Treatment) database.    Proportions of patients adequately managed for HbA1c, systolic blood    pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and albumin/creatinin ratio    (ACR) were calculated for the pathway of (1) risk factor level testing,    (2) treatment intensification when indicated, (3) response to treatment    evaluation.

Findings: Of 11176 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, 9439 with    complete follow-up were included. The majority received annual    examination of HbA1c (86\%) and SBP (86\%), whereas this was 67\% for    LDL-C and 49\% for ACR.

Over 30 billion    nucleotide bases of Illumina shotgun metagenomic data were analyzed from    stool samples collected from four pairs of matched T1D case-control    subjects collected at the time of the development of T1D associated    autoimmunity (i.e., autoantibodies). From these, approximately one    million open reading frames were predicted and compared to the SEED    protein database. Of the 3,849 functions identified in these samples,    144 and 797 were statistically more prevalent in cases and controls,    respectively. Genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, adhesions,    motility, phages, prophages, sulfur metabolism, and stress responses    were more abundant in cases while genes with roles in DNA and protein    metabolism, aerobic respiration, and amino acid synthesis were more    common in controls. These data suggest that increased adhesion and    flagella synthesis in autoimmune subjects may be involved in triggering    a T1D associated autoimmune response. Extensive differences in metabolic    potential indicate that autoimmune subjects have a functionally aberrant    microbiome. Mining 16S rRNA data from these datasets showed a higher    proportion of butyrate-producing and mucin-degrading bacteria in    controls compared to cases, while those bacteria that produce short    chain fatty acids other than butyrate were higher in cases. Thus, a key    rate-limiting step in butyrate synthesis is more abundant in controls.

Our aim was to assess the effects of    both polymorphisms on the risk of T2D.    Methods and Results: In a case-control study from the population-based    Telde cohort, both polymorphisms were analysed by PCR-based methods.    Subjects were classified, according to an oral glucose tolerance test,    into diabetic (N = 115) and pre-diabetic (N = 116); 226 subjects with    normal glucose tolerance, matched for age and gender, were included as    controls. Chi-square (comparison between groups) and logistic regression    (identification of independent effects) were used for analysis. The B1B1    Taq1B CETP genotype frequency increased with worsening glucose    metabolism (42.5\%, 46.1\% and 54.3\% in control, IGR and diabetic    group; p = 0.042). This polymorphism was independently associated with    an increased risk of diabetes (OR: 1.828; IC 95\%: 1.12-2.99; p =    0.016), even after adjusting by confounding variables, whereas the LIPC    polymorphism was not. Regarding the interaction between both    polymorphisms, in the B1B1 genotype carriers, the absence of the minor    (A) allele of the LIPC polymorphism increased the risk of having    diabetes.    Conclusion: The presence of the B1B1 Taq1B CETP genotype contributes to    the presence of diabetes, independently of age, sex, BMI and waist.    However, among carriers of B1B1, the presence of GG genotype of the -250    LIPC polymorphism increases this risk further.}"ISI:000297284900197,"Chemlal, Salim; Colberg, Sheri; Satin-Smith, Marta; Gyuricsko, Eric; Hubbard, Tom; Scerbo, Mark W. & McKenzie, Frederic D.",Blood Glucose Individualized Prediction for Type 2 Diabetes using iPhone Application,,,,,,2011,,"{IEEE 37th Annual Northeast Bioengineering Conference (NEBEC), Rensselaer Polytechn Inst (RPI), Troy, NY, APR 01-03, 2011}",,{2011 IEEE 37TH ANNUAL NORTHEAST BIOENGINEERING CONFERENCE (NEBEC)},,,,,"{Type 2 diabetes is now the most rapidly growing form of diabetes and has    become increasingly common among children.

The study was conducted with respect to conditions of the Bulgarian    health care system, from the perspective of the health care services    payer and included only direct medical costs and benefits.    Cost-effectiveness economic analysis was applied to calculate the cost    per quality adjusted life year (cost/QALY) and the cost per life year    gained (cost/LYG), after modelling the cost of therapy and results from    the clinical trial.    In this model, the Bulgarian cost data were used and therapeutic    practice analysis was performed. Clinical results were based on the LEAD    6 trial, patients demographics and health state utility values were used    as default values determined by the CORE diabetes model. Health state    utility values for disease and treatment-related outcomes were used to    determine quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).    In the base case analysis, the total cost of therapy with liraglutide    was higher than that with exenatide, but the complications cost was    lower, which could be attributed to better haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)    control. Life expectancy and QALYs increased with liraglutide (1.8 mg    ones per day) by 0.129 (SD 0.175) and 0.151 (SD 0.124) years,    respectively. Total costs increased by 4151 Bulgarian Levs (BGN)    resulting in an incremental cost per LYG of BGN 32 082 and incremental    costs per QALY gained of BGN 27 404.    The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that liraglutide (1.8    mg) can be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared to    exenatide, with 71\% probability of being a cost-effective treatment    approach if the willingness to pay threshold is BGN 50 000 (based on    QALY).

The purpose of the study was to    understand how an integrated electronic health record system was used by    health care staff in the treatment and management of diabetes patients.    The investigation was focused on the interface between the primary and    secondary care services which patients access for their diabetes care.    Methods: Observations of the use of an integrated electronic health    record during patients' consultations with health care staff were    conducted over a three month period. Twelve patients were followed    through their consultations with a range of health care staff at a    secondary care Diabetes Centre and in primary care settings. A thematic    analysis of the observation data was undertaken.    Results: The integrated electronic health record system had been    implemented across the primary and secondary care interface and was used    by many, but not all, clinicians involved in the care of patients with    diabetes. In some areas of care it enabled health care staff to access    more accurate and detailed information to inform their clinical    decision-making. Issues including negotiating rules for accessing    patient records and duplication of recording in paper record systems had    not been resolved consistently across services.    Conclusions: The findings offer suggestive evidence that a shared    electronic health record can support more integrated care. Unresolved    issues in implementing the system across all services and settings    highlight the governance problems that can arise when systems are    developed locally but are then extended across organisational and    professional boundaries.

Methods: The Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study    established in 1990 for Cohort I and in 1993 for Cohort II provided    data, and 25,875 men and 33,959 women were analyzed. The response rate    to the baseline questionnaire was 80.9\%, and 68.4\% of the respondents    participated both the 5- and 10-year follow-up surveys. Smoking    cessation was noted during the initial five years and the development of    diabetes was reported in the subsequent five years.    Results: An increased risk was observed among individuals who newly quit    smoking compared with never smokers among men (odds ratio (OR) = 1.42,    95\% CI = 1.03-1.94) and women (OR = 2.84, CI = 1.53-5.29). The risk of    developing diabetes among male new quitters who gained 3 kg or more    during the 5-year follow-up did not substantially differ from the risk    among male never smokers with less than 3 kg of weight gain or no weight    gain, while an increased risk was observed among male new quitters with    less or no weight gain (OR = 1.46, 95\% CI 1.00-2.14). An insignificant    increased risk was observed among male new quitters with a family    history of diabetes compared with male never smokers with a family    history of diabetes. The risk was more than twice as high for male new    quitters who used to smoke 25 or more cigarettes per day compared with    never smokers (OR = 2.15, 95\% CI: 1.34-3.47).    Discussion: An increased risk of diabetes was implied among individuals    who quit smoking.

Objective To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of a CDSS linked    to evidence-based treatment recommendations for type 2 diabetes.    Methods Using the Ontario Diabetes Economic Model, changes in factors    (eg, HbA1c) from a randomized controlled trial were used to estimate    cost-effectiveness. The cost of implementation, development, and    maintenance of the core dataset, and projected diabetes-related    complications were included. The base case assumed a 1-year treatment    effect, 5\% discount rate, and 40-year time horizon. Univariate, one-way    sensitivity analyses were carried out by altering different parameter    values. The perspective was the Ontario Ministry of Health and costs    were in 2010 Canadian dollars.    Results The cost of implementing the intervention was \$483 699. The    one-year intervention reduced HbA1c by 0.2 and systolic blood pressure    by 3.95 mm Hg, but increased body mass index by 0.02 kg/m(2), resulting    in a relative risk reduction of 14\% in the occurrence of amputation.    The model estimated that the intervention resulted in an additional    0.0117 quality-adjusted life year; the incremental cost-effectiveness    ratio was \$160 845 per quality-adjusted life-year.

Methodology: The ENTRED study 2007, a French national survey of people    treated for diabetes, was based on a representative sample of patients    who claimed reimbursement for oral hypoglycaemic agents and/or insulin    at least three times between August 2006 and July 2007, and who were    randomly selected from the database of the two main National Health    Insurance Systems.

T2D is primarily characterized by insulin    resistance, and growing evidence has indicated the causative link    between adipose tissue inflammation and the development of insulin    resistance. Genetic association studies have successfully revealed a    number of important genes consistently associated with T2D to date.    However, these robust T2D-associated genes do not fully elucidate the    mechanisms underlying the development and progression of the disease.    Here, we report an alternative approach, gene expression-based    genome-wide association study (eGWAS): searching for genes repeatedly    implicated in functional microarray experiments (often publicly    available). We performed an eGWAS across 130 independent experiments    (totally 1,175 T2D case-control microarrays) to find additional genes    implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of T2D and identified the    immune-cell receptor CD44 as our top candidate (P = 8.5 x 10(-20)). We    found CD44 deficiency in a diabetic mouse model ameliorates insulin    resistance and adipose tissue inflammation and also found that anti-CD44    antibody treatment decreases blood glucose levels and adipose tissue    macrophage accumulation in a high-fat, diet-fed mouse model. Further, in    humans, we observed CD44 is expressed in inflammatory cells in obese    adipose tissue and discovered serum CD44 levels were positively    correlated with insulin resistance and glycemic control. CD44 likely    plays a causative role in the development of adipose tissue inflammation    and insulin resistance in rodents and humans.

It is suggested that    diabetes-related comorbidity will increase adequate treatment, whereas    diabetes-unrelated comorbidity may decrease this process of care. We    hypothesized that these effects differ according to expected priority of    the conditions.    Methods: We evaluated the relationship between comorbidity and treatment    intensification in a study of 11,248 type 2 diabetes patients using the    GIANTT (Groningen Initiative to Analyse type 2 diabetes Treatment)    database. We formed a cohort of patients with a systolic blood pressure    >= 140 mmHg (6,820 hypertensive diabetics), and a cohort of patients    with an HbA1c >= 7\% (3,589 hyperglycemic diabetics) in 2007. We    differentiated comorbidity by diabetes-related or unrelated conditions    and by priority. High priority conditions include conditions that are    life-interfering, incident or requiring new medication treatment. We    performed Cox regression analyses to assess association with treatment    intensification, defined as dose increase, start, or addition of drugs.    Results: In both the hypertensive and hyperglycemic cohort, only    patients with incident diabetes-related comorbidity had a higher chance    of treatment intensification (HR 4.48, 2.33-8.62 (p<0.001) for    hypertensives; HR 2.37, 1.09-5.17 (p = 0.030) for hyperglycemics).    Intensification of hypertension treatment was less likely when a new    glucose-regulating drug was prescribed (HR 0.24, 0.06-0.97 (p = 0.046)).    None of the prevalent or unrelated comorbidity was significantly    associated with treatment intensification.    Conclusions: Diabetes-related comorbidity induced better risk factor    treatment only for incident cases, implying that appropriate care is    provided more often when complications occur. Diabetes-unrelated    comorbidity did not affect hypertension or hyperglycemia management,    even when it was incident or life-interfering. Thus, the observed    ``undertreatment{''} in diabetes care cannot be explained by constraints    caused by such comorbidity.}"ISI:000305347400057,"Ayele, Ketema; Tesfa, Bisrat; Abebe, Lakew; Tilahun, Tizta & Girma, Eshetu","Self Care Behavior among Patients with Diabetes in Harari, Eastern Ethiopia: The Health Belief Model Perspective",{PLOS ONE},{7},{4},{APR 17},,2012,,,,,,,,,"{Background: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that requires    lifelong medical treatments and a life style adjustment. To prevent    serious morbidity and mortality, it requires dedication to demanding    self-care behaviors in multiple domains. The objective of this study was    to identify predictors of self care behaviors among patients with    diabetes.    Methods: From a total of 425 follow up diabetic patients, a quantitative    cross sectional study was conducted among 222 of them from three    different hospitals in Harar town, from March to April, 2011. The sample    was taken using simple random sampling method. Data was collected using    pretested questionnaire.

In    this report, we explored barriers for physicians which prevent timely    insulin initiation.    Methods: The DAWN JAPAN study is a multicenter, questionnaire-based    survey, conducted between 2004 and 2005. Participating physicians were    categorized as follows based on their expertise: Japan Diabetes Society    (JDS) certified specialists (n = 77), JDS-affiliated physicians (n =    30), and non-JDS-affiliated physicians (n = 27).

Methods: We utilized data from the Danish Civil Registration System to    identify singleton births in Denmark born January 1st 1979 through    December 31st 2008 (N = 1,878,246), and linked them to their parents,    grandparents, and siblings. We categorized children as exposed to    bereavement during prenatal life if their mothers lost an elder child,    husband or parent during the period from one year before conception to    the child's birth. We identified 45,302 children exposed to maternal    bereavement; the remaining children were included in the unexposed    cohort. The outcome of interest was diagnosis of type-2 diabetes. We    estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from birth using log-linear    poisson regression models and used person-years as the offset variable.    All models were adjusted for maternal residence, income, education,    marital status, sibling order, calendar year, sex, and parents' history    of diabetes at the time of pregnancy.    Results: We found children exposed to bereavement during their prenatal    life were more likely to have a type-2 diabetes diagnosis later in life    (aIRR: 1.31, 1.01-1.69). These findings were most pronounced when    bereavement was caused by death of an elder child (aIRR: 1.51,    0.94-2.44). Results also indicated the second trimester of pregnancy to    be the most sensitive period of bereavement exposure (aIRR: 2.08,    1.15-3.76).    Conclusions: Our data suggests that fetal exposure to maternal    bereavement during preconception and the prenatal period may increase    the risk for developing type-2 diabetes in childhood and young    adulthood.}"ISI:000308225500124,"Llaurado, Gemma; Gonzalez-Clemente, Jose-Miguel; Maymo-Masip, Elsa; Subias, David; Vendrell, Joan & Chacon, Matilde R.",Serum Levels of TWEAK and Scavenger Receptor CD163 in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Relationship with Cardiovascular Risk Factors.

Methods: Sixty-eight patients with T1DM and 68 age and sex-matched,    healthy subjects were evaluated. Anthropometrical variables and CV risk    factors were recorded. Serum concentrations of sTWEAK and sCD163 were    measured. AS was assessed by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV). All    statistical analyses were stratified by gender.    Results: T1DM patients showed lower serum concentrations of sTWEAK (Men:    1636.5 (1146.3-3754.8) pg/mL vs. 765.9 (650.4-1097.1) pg/mL; p < 0.001.    Women: 1401.0 (788.0-2422.2) pg/mL vs. 830.1 (562.6-1175.9) pg/mL; p =    0.011) compared with their respective controls. Additionally, T1DM men    had higher serum concentrations of sCD163 (285.0 (247.7-357.1) ng/mL vs.    224.8 (193.3-296.5) ng/mL; p = 0.012) compared with their respective    controls. sTWEAK correlated negatively with aPWV in men (r = -0.443; p <    0.001). However, this association disappeared after adjusting for    potential confounders. In men, the best multiple linear regression model    showed that the independent predictors of sTWEAK were T1DM and WHR (R-2    = 0.640; p < 0.001). In women, T1DM and SBP were the independent    predictors for sTWEAK (R-2 = 0.231; p = 0.001).    Conclusion: sTWEAK is decreased in T1DM patients compared with age and    sex-matched healthy subjects after adjusting for classic CV risk    factors, although sTWEAK levels may be partially influenced by some of    them. Additionally, T1DM men have higher serum concentrations of sCD163.

Purpose The DiaTel study (10 January 2005 to 1 November 2007) compared    active care management (ACM) with home telemonitoring (n=73) to monthly    care coordination (CC) telephone calls (n=77) among veterans with    diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control. The purpose of the Dia Tel    Extension was to assess whether initial improvements could be sustained    with interventions of the same or lower intensity among participants who    re-enrolled in a 6-month extension of DiaTel.    Methods Dia Tel participants receiving ACM were re-assigned randomly to    monthly CC calls with continued telemonitoring but no active medication    management (ACM-to-CCHT, n=23) or monthly CC telephone calls (ACM-to-CC,    n=21).

Objective: To compare the effects of moderate-to-high intensity (HI)    versus low-to-moderate intensity (LI) training of equal energy cost,    i.e. exercise volume, on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.    Design: Pre-specified sub-analysis of the Italian Diabetes and Exercise    Study (IDES), a randomized multicenter prospective trial comparing a    supervised exercise intervention with standard care for 12 months    (2005-2006).    Setting: Twenty-two outpatient diabetes clinics across Italy.    Patients: Sedentary patients with type 2 diabetes assigned to    twice-a-week supervised progressive aerobic and resistance training plus    exercise counseling (n = 303).    Interventions: Subjects were randomized by center to LI (n = 142, 136    completed) or HI (n = 161, 152 completed) progressive aerobic and    resistance training, i.e. at 55\% or 70\% of predicted maximal oxygen    consumption and at 60\% or 80\% of predicted 1-Repetition Maximum,    respectively, of equal volume.    Main Outcome Measure(s): Hemoglobin (Hb) A(1c) and other cardiovascular    risk factors; 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk scores.    Results: Volume of physical activity, both supervised and    non-supervised, was similar in LI and HI participants.

Glucose-insulin    models are widely used in the development of new predictive control    strategies in order to maintain the plasma glucose concentration within    a narrow range, avoiding the risks of high or low levels of glucose in    the blood. However, due to the high variability of this biological    process, the exact values of the model parameters are unknown, but they    can be bounded by intervals. In this work, the computation of tight    glucose concentration bounds under parametric uncertainty for the    development of robust prediction tools is addressed.    A monotonicity analysis of the model states and parameters is performed.    An analysis of critical points, state transformations and application of    differential inequalities are proposed to deal with non-monotone    parameters. In contrast to current methods, the guaranteed simulations    for the glucose-insulin model are carried out by considering uncertainty    in all the parameters and initial conditions. Furthermore, no    time-discretisation is required, which helps to reduce the computational    time significantly.

Access to echocardiography is limited and alternative methods    to identify early heart failure such as the measurement of natriuretic    peptides levels have been proposed. However, their wide biological    variation could limit their clinical utility. Our aim was to determine    if the intrinsic biological variation of one of these peptides,    N-terminal proBNP, is as wide in type 2 diabetes as it is in health and    to calculate the critical difference values that could be utilised in    clinical practice to ensure changes observed between two samples are due    to intervention rather than to its biological variability.    Methodology/Principal Findings: 12 postmenopausal women with diet    controlled type 2 diabetes and without heart failure were compared with    11 control postmenopausal women without diabetes. N-terminal proBNP    levels were measured on 10 occasions. The biological variation was    calculated according to Fraser's methods. The mean NT-proBNP level was    similar in both groups (mean +/- standard deviation; type 2 diabetes,    10.7 pmol/L +/- 8.5 versus 8.49 +/- 6.0 pmol/L, p = 0.42). The    biological variation was also similarly wide. The critical difference in    patients with type 2 diabetes was between -70\% and +/- 236\%.    Conclusions: Type 2 diabetes does not appear to significantly influence    the marked biological variation of N-terminal proBNP in postmenopausal    women. The critical difference values reported in this study could be    used to titrate therapy or monitor response to interventions although    the change required in between samples is wide and this might limit its    utility.

An independent study evaluating utility of these markers    compared with an existing prediction model is yet lacking.    Methods and Findings: We performed a case-cohort study, including random    subcohort (6.5\%) from 38,379 participants with 924 incident diabetes    cases (the Dutch contribution to the European Prospective Investigation    Into Cancer and Nutrition, EPIC-NL, the Netherlands), and another    population-based cohort study including 7,952 participants with 503    incident cases (the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease,    PREVEND, Groningen, the Netherlands). We examined predictive value of    combination of the Liver function tests (gamma-glutamyltransferase,    alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and albumin) above    validated models for 7.5-year risk of diabetes (the Cooperative Health    Research in the Region of Augsburg, the KORA study). Basic model    includes age, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension and parental diabetes.    Clinical models additionally include glucose and uric acid (model1) and    HbA1c (model2). In both studies, addition of Liver function tests to the    basic model improved the prediction (C-statistic by similar to 0.020;    NRI by similar to 9.0\%; P<0.001). In the EPIC-NL case-cohort study,    addition to clinical model1 resulted in statistically significant    improvement in the overall population (C-statistic = +0.009; P<0.001;    NRI = 8.8\%; P<0.001), while addition to clinical model 2 yielded    marginal improvement limited to men (C-statistic = +0.007; P = 0.06; NRI    = 3.3\%; P = 0.04). In the PREVEND cohort study, addition to clinical    model 1 resulted in significant improvement in the overall population    (C-statistic change = 0.008; P = 0.003; NRI = 3.6\%; P = 0.03), with    largest improvement in men (C-statistic change = 0.013; P = 0.01; NRI =    5.4\%; P = 0.04). In PREVEND, improvement compared to clinical model 2    could not be tested because of lack of HbA1c data.    Conclusions: Liver function tests modestly improve prediction for    medium-term risk of incident diabetes above basic and extended clinical    prediction models, only if no HbA1c is incorporated. If data on HbA1c    are available, Liver function tests have little incremental predictive    value, although a small benefit may be present in men.}"ISI:000312600600001,"Kang, Chiyong; Yu, Hyeji & Yi, Gwan-Su",Detecting Type 2 Diabetes Causal Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Combinations from a Genome-Wide Association Study Dataset with Optimal Filtration,,,,,{1-8},2012,,"{6th ACM International Workshop on Data and Text Mining in Biomedical Informatics (DTMBIO) in Conjunction with the 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM), Maui, HI, OCT 29-NOV 02, 2012}",,{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM SIXTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON DATA AND TEXT MINING IN BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},,,,,"{The identification of causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for    complex diseases like type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a challenge because of    the low statistical power of individual markers from a genome-wide    association study (GWAS).

To investigate the    effects of both maternal and paternal hyperglycemia on offspring    phenotypes, we utilized an autosomal dominant mouse model of diabetes    (hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia in Akita mice). We determined metabolic    and skeletal phenotypes in wildtype offspring of Akita mothers and    fathers.    Results: Both maternal and paternal diabetes resulted in phenotypic    changes in wildtype offspring. Phenotypic changes were more pronounced    in male offspring than in female offspring. Maternal hyperglycemia    resulted in metabolic and skeletal phenotypes in male wildtype    offspring. Decreased bodyweight and impaired glucose tolerance were    observed as were reduced whole body bone mineral density and reduced    trabecular bone mass. Phenotypic changes in offspring of diabetic    fathers differed in effect size from changes in offspring of diabetic    mothers. Male wildtype offspring developed a milder metabolic phenotype,    but a more severe skeletal phenotype. Female wildtype offspring of    diabetic fathers were least affected.    Conclusions: Both maternal and paternal diabetes led to the development    of metabolic and skeletal changes in wildtype offspring, with a greater    effect of maternal diabetes on metabolic parameters and of paternal    diabetes on skeletal development. The observed changes are unlikely to    derive from Mendelian inheritance, since the investigated offspring did    not inherit the Akita mutation.

In this study, graphical index of separation (GIOS) was    employed to discover the potential biomarkers of fatty acids for T2DM    and subsequently investigate whether the fatty acid differences exist    between T2DM patients with low and high FPG values (low fasting plasma    glucose.

In healthy individuals, beta-cells maintain plasma glucose    concentrations within a narrow range in concert with insulin action    among multiple tissues. Postprandial elevations in blood glucose    facilitate glucose uptake into beta-cells by diffusion through glucose    transporters residing at the plasma membrane. Glucose transport is    essential for glycolysis and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In    human Type 2 diabetes and in the mouse model of obesity-associated    diabetes, a marked deficiency of beta-cell glucose transporters and    glucose uptake occurs with the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin    secretion. Recent studies have shown that the preservation of glucose    transport in beta-cells maintains normal insulin secretion and blocks    the development of obesity-associated diabetes. To further elucidate the    underlying mechanisms, we have constructed a computational model of    human beta-cell glucose transport in health and in Type 2 diabetes, and    present a systems analysis based on experimental results from human and    animal studies. Our findings identify a metabolic threshold or ``tipping    point{''} whereby diminished glucose transport across the plasma    membrane of beta-cells limits intracellular glucose-6-phosphate    production by glucokinase.

Effects of Zn deficiency on diabetes-induced hepatic injury    were investigated.    Methods: Type 1 diabetes was induced in FVB mice with multiple low-dose    streptozotocin. Hyperglycemic and age-matched control mice were treated    with and without Zn chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis (2-pyridylemethyl)    ethylenediamine (TPEN), at 5 mg/kg body-weight daily for 4 months.

Results: Hepatic Zn deficiency (lower than control level, p<0.05) was    seen in the mice with either diabetes or TPEN treatment and more evident    in the mice with both diabetes and TPEN. Zn deficiency exacerbated    hepatic injuries, shown by further increased serum ALT, hepatic lipid    accumulation, inflammation, oxidative damage, and endoplasmic reticulum    stress-related cell death in Diabetes/TPEN group compared to Diabetes    alone.

Methods: We recruited 8,774 insulin-naive diabetes patients from the    Shanghai Diabetes Registry (SDR). The follow-up rate was 85.4\%. All    subjects were divided into the insulin use cohort (n = 3,639) and the    non-insulin use cohort (n = 5,135). The primary outcome was the first    diagnosis of any cancer.

However, effect of genetic risk    variants on continuous glycemic measures in nondiabetic subjects mainly    elucidates perturbation of insulin secretion. Also, the disease    associated genes do not clearly converge on functional categories    consistent with the known aspects of T2D pathophysiology. We used a    systems biology approach to unravel genome to phenome correlation in    T2D. We first examined enrichment of pathways in genes identified in T2D    GWASs at genome-wide or lower levels of significance. Genes at lower    significance threshold showed enrichment of insulin secretion related    pathway. Notably, physical and genetic interaction network of these    genes showed robust enrichment of insulin signaling and other T2D    pathophysiology related pathways including insulin secretion. The    network also overrepresented genes reported to interact with insulin    secretion and insulin action targeting antidiabetic drugs. The drug    interacting genes themselves showed overrepresentation of insulin    signaling and other T2D relevant pathways. Next, we generated    genome-wide expression profiles of multiple insulin responsive tissues    from nondiabetic and diabetic patients. Remarkably, the differentially    expressed genes showed significant overlap with the network genes, with    the intersection showing enrichment of insulin signaling and other    pathways consistent with T2D pathophysiology. Literature search led our    genomic, interactomic, transcriptomic and toxicogenomic evidence to    converge on TGF-beta signaling, a pathway known to play a crucial role    in pancreatic islets development and function, and insulin signaling.    Cumulatively, we find that GWAS genes relate directly to insulin    secretion and indirectly, through collaborating with other genes, to    insulin resistance. This seems to support the epidemiological evidence    that environmentally triggered insulin resistance interacts with    genetically programmed beta cell dysfunction to precipitate diabetes.}"ISI:000313552400057,"Amitani, Haruka; Asakawa, Akihiro; Cheng, Kaichun; Amitani, Marie; Kaimoto, Kaori; Nakano, Masako; Ushikai, Miharu; Li, Yingxiao; Tsai, Minglun; Li, Jiang-Bo; Terashi, Mutsumi; Chaolu, Huhe; Kamimura, Ryozo & Inui, Akio",Hydrogen Improves Glycemic Control in Type1 Diabetic Animal Model by Promoting Glucose Uptake into Skeletal Muscle,{PLOS ONE},{8},{1},{JAN 10},,2013,,,,,,,,,"{Hydrogen (H-2) acts as a therapeutic antioxidant.

Effective population    strategies to prevent diabetes have not been determined but two broad    strategies have been proposed: ``high-risk'' and ``community-wide''    strategies.    Methods: We modelled the potential effectiveness of two strategies to    prevent 10\% of new cases of diabetes in Ontario, Canada over a 5-year    period. The 5-year risk of developing physician-diagnosed diabetes was    estimated for respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey 2003    (CCHS 2.1, N = 26 232) using a validated and calibrated diabetes risk    tool (Diabetes Population Risk Tool {[}DPoRT]). We estimated how many    cases of diabetes could be prevented using two different strategies: a)    a community-wide strategy that would uniformly reduce body mass index    (BMI) in the entire population; and b) a high baseline risk strategy    using either pharmacotherapy or lifestyle counselling to treat people    who have an increased risk of developing diabetes.    Results: In 2003, the 5-year risk of developing diabetes was 4.7\% (383    600 new diagnosed cases of diabetes in 8 189 000 Ontarians aged 20+) and    risk was moderately diffused (0.5\%, 3.1\% and 17.9\% risk in the 1st,    5th (median) and 10th deciles of risk). A 10\% reduction in new cases of    diabetes would have been achieved under any of the following scenarios:    if BMI was 3.5\% lower in the entire population; if lifestyle    counselling covered 32.2\% of high-risk people (371 900 of 1 155 000    people with 5 year diabetes risk greater than 10\%); or, if    pharmacotherapy covered 65.2\% of high-risk people.    Conclusions: Prevention using pharmacotherapy alone requires    unrealistically high coverage levels to achieve modest population    reduction in new diabetes cases.

The aim of the present study was to examine such    adaptation in a model of type 2 diabetes and assess how the retina    responds to the subsequent institution of glycemic control.    Methods: Electroretinography (ERG) was conducted on untreated Zucker    diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and congenic controls from 8-22 weeks of age    and on ZDFs treated with daily insulin from 16-22 weeks of age. Retinal    sections from various ages were prepared and compared histologically and    by immunocytochemistry.    Principal Findings/Conclusions: Acute hyperglycemia did not have an    effect on control rats while chronic hyperglycemia in the ZDF was    associated with scotopic ERG amplitudes which were up to 20\% higher    than those of age-matched controls. This change followed the onset of    hyperglycemia with a delay of over one month, supporting that    habituation to hyperglycemia is a slow process. When glycemia was    lowered, an immediate decrease in ZDF photoreceptoral activity was    induced as seen by a reduction in a-wave amplitudes and maximum slopes    of about 30\%. A direct effect of insulin on the ERG was unlikely since    the expression of phosphorylated Akt kinase was not affected by    treatment. The electrophysiological differences between untreated ZDFs    and controls preceded an activation of Muller cells in the ZDFs    (up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein), which was attenuated    by insulin treatment. There were otherwise no signs of cell death or    morphological alterations in any of the experimental groups. These data    show that under chronic hyperglycemia, the ZDF retina became abnormally    sensitive to variations in substrate supply. In diabetes, a similar    inability to cope with intensive glucose lowering could render the    retina susceptible to damage.}"ISI:000314692800009,"Jensen, Richard A.; Sim, Xueling; Li, Xiaohui; Cotch, Mary Frances; Ikram, M.

We conducted a genome-wide    association study (GWAS) of mild retinopathy in persons without    diabetes.    Methods: A working group agreed on phenotype harmonization, covariate    selection and analytic plans for within-cohort GWAS. An inverse-variance    weighted fixed effects meta-analysis was performed with GWAS results    from six cohorts of 19,411 Caucasians. The primary analysis included    individuals without diabetes and secondary analyses were stratified by    hypertension status. We also singled out the results from single    nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously shown to be associated with    diabetes and hypertension, the two most common causes of retinopathy.    Results: No SNPs reached genome-wide significance in the primary    analysis or the secondary analysis of participants with hypertension.    SNP, rs12155400, in the histone deacetylase 9 gene (HDAC9) on chromosome    7, was associated with retinopathy in analysis of participants without    hypertension, -1.3 +/- 0.23 (beta +/- standard error), p=6.6x10(-9).    Evidence suggests this was a false positive finding. The minor allele    frequency was low (similar to 2\%), the quality of the imputation was    moderate (r(2) similar to 0.7), and no other common variants in the    HDAC9 gene were associated with the outcome. SNPs found to be associated    with diabetes and hypertension in other GWAS were not associated with    retinopathy in persons without diabetes or in subgroups with or without    hypertension.    Conclusions: This GWAS of retinopathy in individuals without diabetes    showed little evidence of genetic associations. Further studies are    needed to identify genes associated with these signs in order to help    unravel novel pathways and determinants of microvascular diseases.}"ISI:000315044701085,"Thirugnanam, Mythili; Kumar, Praveen; Srivatsan, S.

Most of the researchers have proposed    different systems to diagnose diabetes, in spite of which the accuracy    of the prediction rate of diabetes is not so significant. Most of the    techniques suggested were to detect diabetes associated with the parts    of the body such as eye, heart or legs. All the developed systems aimed    to identify diabetes by increasing the accuracy of the prediction rate    but fail to do so in most of the cases as there were some issues that    had not been discussed. The existing systems had number of drawbacks    like some were only concentrated for women and who were less than 21    years old {[}5], some gave greater accuracy if only one data set was    used {[}6], some needed dataset of very good quality {[}12], some needed    to standardize the ontology {[}10] and some even failed to show the    performance of the developed systems {[}7]. So there is an need to    develop a diabetes diagnosis system that improves the accuracy of the    prediction rate by considering all the factors into account. This paper    presents a novel approach for diagnosis of diabetes which has two stages    to predict the diabetes status. The initial prediction stage adopts two    computational intelligence and knowledge engineering techniques such as    fuzzy logic (F), neural network (N) and case based reasoning (C) as an    individual approach (FCN). The final prediction stage applies rule based    algorithm to the values obtained from the initial stage. The benefit of    applying these stages is that the accuracy of prediction rate will be    higher when compared to using only the initial prediction stage done by    most of the suggested systems for predicting the occurrence of diabetes    mellitus.

Building    upon these findings, the goals of this study were to determine whether    a) glycemic control prevents this erratic cerebral neovascularization in    the GK model, and b) this pathological neovascularization pattern occurs    in Lepr(db/db) model, which is the most commonly used model of T2D for    studies involving cerebral complications of diabetes. Vascular volume,    surface area and structural parameters including microvessel/macrovessel    ratio, non-FITC (fluorescein) perfusing vessel abundance, vessel    tortuosity, and branch density were measured by 3D reconstruction of    FITC stained vasculature in GK rats or Lepr(db/db) mice. GK rats    exhibited an increase in all of these parameters, which were prevented    by glycemic control with metformin. In Lepr(db/db) mice, microvascular    density was increased but there was no change in nonFITC-perfusing    vessels. Increased PA branch density was associated with reduced branch    diameter. These results suggest that T2D leads to cerebral    neovascularization and remodeling but some structural characteristics of    newly formed vessels differ between these models of T2D. The prevention    of dysfunctional cerebral neovascularization by early glucose control    suggests that hyperglycemia is a mediator of this response.}"ISI:000315159200031,"Icks, Andrea; Albers, Bernd; Haastert, Burkhard; Pechlivanis, Sonali; Pundt, Noreen; Slomiany, Uta; Erbel, Raimund; Joeckel, Karl-Heinz; Kruse, Johannes; Kulzer, Bernd; Nowotny, Bettina; Herder, Christian; Giani, Guido & Moebus, Susanne",Risk for High Depressive Symptoms in Diagnosed and Previously Undetected Diabetes: 5-Year Follow-Up Results of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study,{PLOS ONE},{8},{2},{FEB 18},,2013,,,,,,,,,"{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the risk for the    development of high depressive symptoms in study participants with    diagnosed and previously undetected diabetes mellitus compared to those    without diabetes in a prospective population-based cohort study in    Germany.    Methods: We estimated the 5-year cumulative incidence of high depressive    symptoms in participants without high depressive symptoms at baseline (n    = 3,633, 51.4\% men, mean age (SD) 59.1 (7.6) years, 7.0\% diagnosed    diabetes, 5.3\% previously undetected diabetes) from the    population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall study. Diabetes was assessed by    self-report, medication, and blood glucose. High depressive symptoms    were assessed using CES-D. We calculated odds ratios and their    corresponding 95\% confidence interval, using multiple logistic    regression analyses.    Result: Cumulative 5-year incidences (95\% CI) of high depressive    symptoms in participants with diagnosed, undetected, and without    diabetes were 7.1 (4.2-10.9), 4.1 (1.8-8.0), and 6.5 (5.6-7.4),    respectively. The age-sex-adjusted OR for developing high depressive    symptoms was 1.22 (0.74-2.03) in participants with diagnosed compared to    those without diabetes, and 1.00 (0.59-1.68) after adjustment for BMI,    physical activity, education, stroke, and myocardial infarction. The    age-sex adjusted OR for developing high depressive symptoms in    participants with previously undetected diabetes compared to those    without diabetes was 0.72; 0.35-1.48; and fully adjusted 0.62;    0.30-1.30.    Conclusion: We found no significant associations, maybe due to low    power. However, our results are in line with a recent meta-analysis    suggesting that risk of developing high depressive symptoms in patients    with diagnosed diabetes may be moderately higher than in those without    diabetes, and that comorbidity may explain in part this association. In    participants with previously undetected diabetes, this first    longitudinal study indicates that the risk is not increased or may even    be decreased.

An extract of Artemisia dracunculus L.    (termed PMI5011) improves insulin action by increasing insulin signaling    in skeletal muscle. We sought to determine if the effect of PMI5011 on    insulin signaling extends to regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome    system. C2C12 myotubes and the KK-A(y) murine model of type 2 diabetes    were used to evaluate the effect of PMI5011 on steady-state levels of    ubiquitylation, proteasome activity and expression of Atrogin-1 and    MuRF-1, muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases that are upregulated with    impaired insulin signaling. Our results show that PMI5011 inhibits    proteasome activity and steady-state ubiquitylation levels in vitro and    in vivo. The effect of PMI5011 is mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling and    correlates with decreased expression of Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1. Under in    vitro conditions of hormonal or fatty acid-induced insulin resistance,    PMI5011 improves insulin signaling and reduces Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1    protein levels. In the KK-A(y) murine model of type 2 diabetes, skeletal    muscle ubiquitylation and proteasome activity is inhibited and Atrogin-1    and MuRF-1 expression is decreased by PMI5011. PMI5011-mediated changes    in the ubiquitin-proteasome system in vivo correlate with increased    phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3a and increased myofiber size. The    changes in Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 expression, ubiquitin-proteasome    activity and myofiber size modulated by PMI5011 in the presence of    insulin resistance indicate the botanical extract PMI5011 may have    therapeutic potential in the preservation of muscle mass in type 2    diabetes.}"ISI:000315524900205,"Lamb, Molly M.; Simpson, Melissa D.; Seifert, Jennifer; Scott, Fraser W.; Rewers, Marian & Norris, Jill M.","The Association between IgG4 Antibodies to Dietary Factors, Islet Autoimmunity and Type 1 Diabetes: The Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young",{PLOS ONE},{8},{2},{FEB 28},,2013,,,,,,,,,"{Background: Infant dietary exposures have been linked to type 1 diabetes    (T1D) development.

We explored the efficacy    and systems effects of pharmaceutical interventions versus dietary    lifestyle intervention (DLI) in developing T2DM and complications. To    mimic the situation in humans, high fat diet (HFD)-fed LDLr-/- mice with    already established disease phenotype were treated with ten different    drugs mixed into HFD or subjected to DLI (switch to low-fat chow), for 7    weeks. Interventions were compared to untreated reference mice kept on    HFD or chow only. Although most of the drugs improved HFD-induced    hyperglycemia, drugs only partially affected other risk factors and also    had limited effect on disease progression towards microalbuminuria,    hepatosteatosis and atherosclerosis. By contrast, DLI normalized T2DM    risk factors, fully reversed hepatosteatosis and microalbuminuria, and    tended to attenuate atherogenesis. The comprehensive beneficial effect    of DLI was reflected by normalized metabolite profiles in plasma and    liver. Analysis of disease pathways in liver confirmed reversion of the    metabolic distortions with DLI.

Methods: The analysis was based on a nationally representative sample of    1432 adult subjects, recruited for the ORISCAV-LUX survey (2007-2008).    Descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses were    performed. The 10-year Framingham risk score was calculated for each    participant who classified at low, intermediate and high risk.    Results: Among the diagnosed cases, 32\%, 60\%, and 85\% were    respectively unaware of their diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia.    Increasing age and BMI were the strongest protective factors against    unawareness of hypertension and dyslipidemia. Having a family history    decreased the risk of unawareness of hypertension (OR = 0.57; 95\% CI    0.36, 0.92; P = 0.021), whereas, not having a family doctor increased    double-fold the odd of being unaware of hypertension (P = 0.048). Poor    health perception reduced significantly the risk of unawareness of    dyslipidemia (OR = 0.27; 95\% CI 0.11, 0.68).

We therefore examined whether genetic predisposition    to higher BMI or T2D was associated with shortened leukocyte telomere    length (LTL).    Methodology: We conducted an analysis of 3,968 women of European    ancestry aged 43-70 years from the Nurses' Health Study, who were    selected as cases or controls in genome-wide association studies and    studies of telomeres and disease. Pre-diagnostic relative telomere    length in peripheral blood leukocytes, collected in 1989-1990, was    measured by quantitative PCR. We combined information from multiple risk    variants by calculating genetic risk scores based on 32 polymorphisms    near 32 loci for BMI, and 36 polymorphisms near 35 loci for T2D.    Findings: After adjustment for age and case-control status, there was no    association between the BMI genetic risk score and LTL (beta per    standard deviation increase: -0.01; SE: 0.02; P = 0.52). Similarly, the    T2D genetic score was not associated with LTL (b per standard deviation    increase: -0.006; SE: 0.02; P = 0.69).    Conclusions: In this population of middle-aged and older women of    European ancestry, those genetically predisposed to higher BMI or T2D    did not possess shortened telomeres. Although we cannot exclude weak or    modest effects, our findings do not support a causal relation of strong    magnitude between these metabolic conditions and telomere dynamics.}"ISI:000316532100015,"Padilla-Medina, Jose A.; Prado-Olivarez, Juan; Amador-Licona, Norma; Cardona-Torres, Luz M.; Galicia-Resendiz, Delia & Diaz-Carmona, Javier",Study on simple reaction and choice times in patients with type I diabetes,{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},{43},{4},{MAY 1},{368-376},2013,,,,,,,,,"{A study on simple reaction time (SRT) and choice reaction time in    patients having diabetes is described in this paper. The study was    applied to fourteen patients with type I diabetes, as well as to    fourteen non-diabetic persons. The research is based on two visual    signal perception experiments, both implemented on a computer based    environment. The SRT experiment consisted on measuring participants'    reaction times to a light change event in a simulated traffic light    scenario. The choice reaction time was studied through the performance    indexes (d') achieved by participants in a two alternative forced    experiment where a known visual signal is identified from two noisy    images. According to the obtained results, the diabetic patients' SRTs    were an average of 24\% longer than the reaction time of non-diabetic    persons, in the same way a significant average difference of 41\% was    obtained in the efficient index d' too. A positive correlation of 0.6594    between the time periods since diabetes has been diagnosed and the    average SRTs of diabetic patients was obtained, also significant    correlation differences between age of all experiments participants and    resulting variables, SRTs and d', were observed; for instance the    correlation factor between participants' ages and their average SRTs was    0.8529 for diabetic patients, meanwhile a value of -0.2905 was obtained    for non-diabetic persons. The evidence suggests that the time period    since diabetes has been diagnosed notably affects motor and sensorial    systems maturity, and consequently conduction speed of sural and    peroneal nerves.

We report pooled analyses of data from    three European trial cohorts: to analyse T2D incidence, sustained weight    loss and utility of risk predictors.    Methods: We analysed data on 749 adults with impaired glucose tolerance    (278 men and 471 women, mean age 56 years, mean BMI 31 kgm(-2))    recruited between 1993 and 2003, and randomised to intensive lifestyle    intervention (I) or lifestyle advice control (C). The intervention aimed    to increase physical activity, modify diet, and promote weight loss >=    5\%. Using Cox-regression survival analysis, we assessed T2D incidence    and the impact on T2D incidence of sustained weight loss, and of    baseline cut-point values of FINDRISC score, fasting plasma glucose    (FPG), and HbA(1c).    Results: Mean follow-up duration was 3.1 years. T2D was diagnosed in 139    participants (I = 45/379, C = 94/370). Cumulative T2D incidence was 57\%    lower in the intervention compared with the control group (HR 0.42 (95\%    CI 0.29 to 0.60) P<0.001). Participants with >= 5\% weight loss at one    year had 65\% lower T2D incidence (HR 0.35 (95\% CI 0.22 to 0.56)    P<0.001); maintaining >= 5\% weight loss for two and three years further    reduced T2D incidence. Recommended cut-points to identify those at high    risk for T2D would have identified different proportions of European    Diabetes Prevention Study (EDIPS) participants with similar    hazard-ratios for intervention effect.    Conclusions: Pooled analysis of EDIPS trial data reinforces evidence for    T2D prevention by lifestyle intervention. Analysis showed the preventive    effect of >= 5\% weight loss, especially if maintained long term, which    has utility for intervention monitoring.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate    STG-55 for device usability, performance of blood glucose measurement,    glycemic control characteristics in vivo in animal experiments, and    evaluate its clinical feasibility. There are several features for    usability improvement based on the design concepts, such as compactness,    display monitor, batteries, guidance function, and reduction of the    preparation time. All animal study data were compared with a clinically    available artificial pancreas system in Japan (control device: STG-22).    We examined correlations of both blood glucose levels between two groups    (STG-55 vs. control) using Clarke's error grid analysis, and also    compared mean glucose infusion rate (GIR) during glucose clamp. The    results showed strong correlation in blood glucose concentrations    (Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient: 0.97; n=1636).    Clarke's error grid analysis showed that 98.4\% of the data fell in    Zones A and B, which represent clinically accurate or benign errors,    respectively. The difference in mean GIRs was less than 0.2mg/kg/min,    which was considered not significant. Clinical feasibility study    demonstrated sufficient glycemic control maintaining target glucose    range between 80 and 110 (mg/dL), and between 140 and 160 without any    hypoglycemia.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and    associates of bacterial infection severe enough to require    hospitalization in well-characterized community-based patients with type    2 diabetes.    Methods and Findings: We studied a cohort of 1,294 patients (mean +/- SD    age 64.1 +/- 11.3 years) from the longitudinal observational Fremantle    Diabetes Study Phase I (FDS1) and 5,156 age-, gender-and    zip-code-matched non-diabetic controls. The main outcome measure was    incident hospitalization for bacterial infection as principal diagnosis    between 1993 and 2010. We also examined differences in statin use in 52    FDS1 pairs hospitalized with pneumonia (cases) or a contemporaneous    non-infection-related cause (controls). During 12.0 +/- 5.4 years of    follow-up, 251 (19.4\%) patients were hospitalized on 368 occasions for    infection (23.7/1,000 patient-years). This was more than double the rate    in matched controls (incident rate ratio (IRR) (95\% CI), 2.13    (1.88-2.42), P < 0.001). IRRs for pneumonia, cellulitis, and    septicemia/bacteremia were 1.86 (1.55-2.21), 2.45 (1.92-3.12), and 2.08    (1.41-3.04), respectively (P < 0.001).

The pathogenic processes underlying CEL-MODY are poorly    understood, and the global knockout mouse model of the CEL gene (CELKO)    did not recapitulate the disease. We therefore aimed to create and    phenotype a mouse model specifically over-expressing mutated CEL in the    pancreas.    Methods: We established a monotransgenic floxed (flanking LOX sequences)    mouse line carrying the human CEL mutation c.1686delT and crossed it    with an elastase-Cre mouse to derive a bitransgenic mouse line with    pancreas-specific overexpression of CEL carrying this disease-associated    mutation (TgCEL).

Results: Pancreatic exocrine function was normal in TgCEL mice on normal    chow as assessed by serum lipid and lipid-soluble vitamin levels, fecal    elastase and fecal fat absorption, and the normoglycemic mice exhibited    normal pancreatic morphology. On 60\% HFD, the mice gained weight to the    same extent as controls, had normal pancreatic exocrine function and    comparable glucose tolerance even after resuming normal diet and follow    up up to 22 months of age. The cerulein-exposed TgCEL mice gained weight    and remained glucose tolerant, and there were no detectable    mutation-specific differences in serum amylase, islet hormones or the    extent of pancreatic tissue inflammation.

Results: The prevalence of PN was 8.4\%, 2.8\%, and 1.5\% in diabetes    mellitus, IGR, and NGT subjects, respectively (P<0.05 for diabetes vs.    NGT, and IGR). The subjects with known diabetes had the highest    frequency of PN (13.1\%).

Among the IGR subjects, other than age, the 2-h    postprandial plasma glucose level was an independent factor    significantly associated with PN. Meanwhile, among the subjects with    diabetes, PN was associated with fasting plasma glucose, duration of    diabetes, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate.    Conclusions: The prevalence of PN is slightly higher in individuals with    IGR than that in individuals with NGT, but small fibre damage in IGR as    the earliest nerve fibre deficit may be underestimated in our study. As    an independent risk factor, postprandial plasma glucose level may be an    important target for strategies to prevent or improve PN in IGR    subjects.}"ISI:000317907200084,"Islam, Md.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Twenty-seven parents of 24 young persons    aged 10-17 with T1DM participated in eight focus group interviews during    their regular visits to a county hospital. Focus group discussions were    video/audio-taped, transcribed and analysed using inductive qualitative    content analysis. Self-reported demographic and medical information was    also collected. A main theme was Finding things out, including two    sub-themes, Trust and Suitability. The latter were key factors affecting    parents' perceptions of online resources. Parents' choice of information    source was related to the situation, previous experiences and knowledge    about sources and, most importantly, the level of trust in the source. A    constantly present background theme was Life situation, including two    sub-themes, Roles and functions and Emotions and needs. Parents'    information-seeking regarding T1DM varied greatly, and was closely    associated with their life situation, the adolescents development phases    and the disease trajectory.    Conclusions/Significance: Health practitioners and system developers    need to focus on creating trust and suitability for users' needs.

However, it often requires multiple donors to accomplish    insulin-independence and the long-term results are not yet satisfying.    Therefore, novel ways to overcome these problems have been explored.    Isolated islets are fragile and susceptible to pro-apoptotic factors and    poorly proliferative. In contrast, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are    highly proliferative, anti-apoptotic and pluripotent to differentiate    toward various cell types, promote angiogenesis and modulate    inflammation, thereby studied as an enhancer of islet function and    engraftment. Electrofusion is an efficient method of cell fusion and    nuclear reprogramming occurs in hybrid cells between different cell    types. Therefore, we hypothesized that electrofusion between MSC and    islet cells may yield robust islet cells for diabetes therapy. We    establish a method of electrofusion between dispersed islet cells and    MSCs in rats. The fusion cells maintained glucose-responsive insulin    release for 20 days in vitro. Renal subcapsular transplantation of    fusion cells prepared from suboptimal islet mass (1,000 islets) that did    not correct hyperglycemia even if co-transplanted with MSCs, caused slow    but consistent lowering of blood glucose with significant weight gain    within the observation period in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.    In the fusion cells between rat islet cells and mouse MSCs, RT-PCR    showed new expression of both rat MSC-related genes and mouse    beta-cell-related genes, indicating bidirectional reprogramming of both    beta-cell and MSCs nuclei. Moreover, decreased caspase3 expression and    new expression of Ki-67 in the islet cell nuclei suggested alleviated    apoptosis and gain of proliferative capability, respectively.

Three factors affected whether lifestyle changes were    implemented: obtaining new knowledge, taking responsibility, and    receiving confirmation of an already healthy lifestyle. Four factors    motivated individuals to maintain changes: support from others,    experiencing an effect, fear of complications, and the formation of new    habits.    Conclusion: Knowledge was used to make and maintain changes in diet,    medication and physical activity. Knowledge also acted as confirmation    of an already adequate lifestyle.

Other etiological factors may be responsible for the development of    adverse pregnancy outcome. Acceptance of the semi-allogeneic fetus is    accompanied by adaptations in the maternal immune-response.    Maladaptations of the immune-response has been shown to contribute to    pregnancy complications. We hypothesized that type 1 diabetes, as an    autoimmune disease, may be associated with maladaptations of the    immune-response to pregnancy, possibly resulting in pregnancy    complications.    Methods: We studied pregnancy outcome and pregnancy-induced    immunological adaptations in a normoglycemic rat-model of type 1    diabetes, i.e. biobreeding diabetes-prone rats (BBDP; 5 non-pregnant    rats, 7 pregnant day 10 rats and 6 pregnant day 18 rats), versus    non-diabetic control rats (i.e. congenic non-diabetic biobreeding    diabetes-resistant (BBDR; 6 non-pregnant rats, 6 pregnant day 10 rats    and 6 pregnant day 18 rats) and Wistar-rats (6 non-pregnant, 6 pregnant    day 10 rats and 5 pregnant day 18 rats)).    Results: We observed reduced litter size, lower fetal weight of viable    fetuses and increased numbers of resorptions versus control rats. These    complications are accompanied by various differences in the    immune-response between BBDP and control rats in both pregnant and    non-pregnant animals. The immune-response in non-pregnant BBDP-rats was    characterized by decreased percentages of lymphocytes, increased    percentages of effector T-cells, regulatory T-cells and natural killer    cells, an increased Th1/Th2-ratio and activated monocytes versus Wistar    and BBDR-rats. Furthermore, pregnancy-induced adaptations in BBDP-rats    coincided with an increased Th1/Th2-ratio, a decreased mean fluorescence    intensity CD161a/NKR-P1b ratio and no further activation of monocytes    versus non-diabetic control rats.

Compared with the    controls, the covariate adjusted HR for breast and endometrial cancer    was 1.42 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-1.50) and 1.71 (95\% CI    1.48-1.97), respectively in women with diabetes. Elderly (>=65 years)    diabetes had the highest HR (1.61) of breast cancer, while the highest    HR (1.85) of endometrial cancer was observed in diabetes aged <=50    years.    Conclusions: Diabetes may significantly increase the risks of breast and    endometrial cancer in all age stratifications.

The current study aims to identify risk factors that    mediate the relationship between diabetes and falls.    Methods: 199 older adults (104 with diabetes and 95 healthy controls)    underwent a medical screening. Gait (GAITRite (R)), balance (AccuGait    (R) force plate), grip strength (Jamar (R)), and cognitive status    (Mini-Mental State Examination and Clock Drawing Test) were assessed.    Falls were prospectively recorded during a 12-month follow-up period    using monthly calendars.    Results: Compared to controls, diabetes participants scored worse on all    physical and cognitive measures. Sixty-four participants (42 diabetes    vs. 22 controls) reported at least one injurious fall or two    non-injurious falls ({''}fallers{''}). Univariate logistic regression    identified diabetes as a risk factor for future falls (Odds Ratio 2.25,    95\%CI 1.21-4.15, p = 0.010). Stepwise multiple regressions defined    diabetes and poor balance as independent risk factors for falling.    Taking more medications, slower walking speed, shorter stride length and    poor cognitive performance were mediators that reduced the Odds Ratio of    the relationship between diabetes and faller status relationship the    most followed by reduced grip strength and increased stride length    variability.    Conclusions: Diabetes is a major risk factor for falling, even after    controlling for poor balance. Taking more medications, poorer walking    performance and reduced cognitive functioning were mediators of the    relationship between diabetes and falls. Tailored preventive programs    including systematic medication reviews, specific balance exercises and    cognitive training might be beneficial in reducing fall risk in older    adults suffering from diabetes.}"ISI:000321425300035,"Nicholas, Jennifer; Charlton, Judith; Dregan, Alex & Gulliford, Martin C.",Recent HbA1c Values and Mortality Risk in Type 2 Diabetes.

The study    aim is to assess this additive utility in a large Japanese population.    Methods: We used data from a retrospective cohort study conducted from    1998 to 2002 for the baseline and 2002 to 2006 for follow-up, inclusive    of 5,142 men (mean age of 51.9 years) and 4,847 women (54.1 years) at    baseline. The cumulative incidence of diabetes {[}defined either as a    fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >= 7.00 mmol/l or as clinically diagnosed    diabetes] was measured. In addition to glycaemic biomarkers {[}FPG and    hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)], we examined the clinical usefulness of adding    non-glycaemic biomarkers and non-blood biomarkers, using sensitivity and    specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver    operating characteristics.    Results: The AUCs to predict diabetes were 0.874 and 0.924 for FPG,    0.793 and 0.822 for HbA1c, in men and women, respectively. Glycaemic    biomarkers were the best and second-best for diabetes prediction among    the markers. All non-glycaemic markers (except uric acid in men and    creatinine in both sexes) predicted diabetes. Among these biomarkers,    the highest AUC in the single-marker analysis was 0.656 for alanine    aminotransferase (ALT) in men and 0.740 for body mass index in women.    The AUC of the combined markers of FPG and HbA1c was 0.895 in men and    0.938 in women, which were marginally increased to 0.904 and 0.940 when    adding ALT, respectively.

First, the prediction capabilities    of molecular docking and pharmacophore mapping to distinguish inhibitors    from noninhibitors for the selected T2DM-related targets were evaluated.    The results show that molecular docking or pharmacophore mapping can    give satisfactory predictions for most targets but the validations are    still quite necessary because the prediction accuracies of these two    methods are variable across different targets. Then, the Bayesian    classifiers by integrating the predictions from molecular docking and    pharmacophore mapping were developed, and the well-validated Bayesian    classifiers for 15 targets were utilized to find the potential    inhibitors from TCM and establish the compound target interaction    network. The analysis of the compound target network demonstrates that a    small portion (18.6\%) of the predicted inhibitors can interact with    multitargets. The pharmacological activities for some potential    inhibitors have been experimentally confirmed, highlighting the    reliability of the Bayesian classifiers. Besides, it is interesting to    find that a considerable number of the predicted multitarget inhibitors    have free radical scavenging/antioxidant activities, which are closely    related to T2DM. It appears that the pharmacological effect of the TCM    formulas is determined not only by the compounds that interact directly    with one or more T2DM-related targets, but also by the compounds with    other supplementary bioactivities important for relieving T2DM, such as    free radical scavenging/antioxidant effects. The mechanism uncovered by    this study may offer a deep insight for understanding the theory of the    classical TCM formulas for combating T2DM. Moreover, the predicted    inhibitors for the T2DM-related targets may provide a good source to    find new lead compounds against T2DM.}"ISI:000322391400060,"Pappada, Scott M.; Cameron, Brent D.; Tulman, David B.; Bourey, Raymond E.; Borst, Marilyn J.; Olorunto, William; Bergese, Sergio D.; Evans, David C.; Stawicki, Stanislaw P.

Fifty-nine patients (mean age 63.0 +/- 12.2 years) were enrolled and 39    were seen at follow-up. IMT increased in the whole cohort during    follow-up. The change in IMT was predicted by the proportion of sdLDL    particles at baseline (p=0.03), and the change in FMD was predicted by    LDL-cholesterol levels at baseline (p=0.049).

In this regard,    face-to-face interactions with peers and professionals were preferred,    with adjunctive roles for Internet/social media. Further, direct    participation of partners/spouses in a DM2 prevention program was viewed    as important to enhance support for behavioural change at home.    Discussants highlighted work and child-related responsibilities as    potential barriers to participation, and emphasized the importance of    childcare support to allow attendance. Meal replacements were viewed    with little interest, with concerns that their use would provide a poor    example of eating behaviour to children.    Conclusions: Among women within 5 years of a GDM diagnosis who    participated in a focus group discussion, participation in a DM2    prevention program would be enhanced by face-to-face interactions with    professionals and peers, provision of childcare support, and inclusion    of spouses/partners.}"ISI:000323350700107,"Yang, Gary K.; Maahs, David M.; Perkins, Bruce A. & Cherney, David Z.

The effect of renal hyperfiltration    on systemic blood pressure (BP) is less clear. We therefore measured BP,    renal hemodynamic function and circulating renin angiotensin aldosterone    system (RAAS) mediators in type 1 DM patients with hyperfiltration (n =    36, DM-H, GFR >= 135 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) or normofiltration (n = 40,    DM-N), and 56 healthy controls (HC). Since renal hyperfiltration    represents a state of intrarenal RAAS activation, we hypothesized that    hyperfiltration would be associated with higher BP and elevated levels    of circulating RAAS mediators.    Methods: BP, glomerular filtration rate (GFR -inulin), effective renal    plasma flow (paraaminohippurate) and circulating RAAS components were    measured in DM-H, DM-N and HC during clamped euglycemia (4-6 mmol/L).    Studies were repeated in DM-H and DM-N during clamped hyperglycemia    (9-11 mmol/L).    Results: Baseline GFR was elevated in DM-H vs. DM-N and HC (167 +/- 6    vs. 11562 and 115 +/- 2 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p<0.0001).

Despite higher SBP in DM-H, plasma aldosterone was    lower in DM-H vs. DM-N and HC (42 +/- 5 vs. 86 +/- 14 vs. 276 +/- 41    ng/dl, p = 0.01). GFR (p<0.0001) and SBP (p<0.0001) increased during    hyperglycemia in DM-N but not in DM-H.    Conclusions: DM-H was associated with higher heart rate and SBP values    and an exaggerated suppression of systemic aldosterone.

Methods and Findings: All patients (n = 89, 40\% female) of the Diabetes    and Atorvastatin (DIATOR) Trial were analyzed at recruitment, i.e. prior    to receiving the study medication. Inclusion criteria were insulin    dependent diabetes for 2 weeks to 3 months, age range 18-39 years, and    islet cell autoantibodies. Blood samples were analyzed for 14 immune    mediators by standard methods. Concentrations of all mediators    correlated with at least one other mediator (p<0.05, Spearman    correlation) giving rise to a network. Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist    (IL1-RA) held a central position and was associated with both pro-and    anti-inflammatory mediators. Further central elements were the    pro-inflammatory mediators CRP and IL-6, the soluble adhesion molecules    sICAM-1 and E-selectin, and MCP-4 which held a central position in the    chemokine network. The two Th1-associated mediators IFN gamma and IP-10    remained outside the network but correlated with each other. All    correlations were positive (r = 0.25-0.72), i.e., high levels of    pro-inflammatory mediators were accompanied by increased levels of    anti-inflammatory mediators. IL-1RA was the only mediator associated    with fasting and liquid mixed meal stimulated C-peptide concentrations    (r = 0.31 and 0.24, p = 0.003 and 0.025, after adjustment for age, sex,    BMI). There were associations between the immune mediator network and    BMI (IL-1RA, CRP, IL-6, MCP-4, MIP-1 beta) but few or no associations    with HbA1c, insulin dose, lipid parameters, age or sex.    Conclusions: In patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes, systemic    acute phase proteins, cytokines, chemokines and soluble adhesion    molecules form a network. Among the few central elements IL-1RA has a    dominant role. IL-1RA is associated with all other groups of mediators    and is the only mediator which correlates (positively) with residual    beta cell function.}"ISI:000324338200109,"Peters, Kirsten E.; Chubb, S.

Metformin may    have cardiovascular benefits beyond blood glucose lowering in type 2    diabetes but its association with hypomagnesemia appears paradoxical.    The aim of this study was to examine relationships between metformin    therapy, magnesium homoeostasis and cardiovascular disease in    well-characterized type 2 patients from the community.    Methods and Findings: We studied 940 non-insulin-treated patients (mean    +/- SD age 63.4 +/- 11.6 years, 49.0\% males) from the longitudinal    observational Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase I (FDS1) who were followed    for 12.3 +/- 5.3 years.

Multivariate methods were used to determine associates of    prevalent and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular    disease (CVD) as ascertained from self-report and linked    morbidity/mortality databases. 19\% of patients were hypomagnesemic    (serum magnesium <0.70 mmol/L). Patients on metformin, alone or combined    with a sulfonylurea, had lower serum magnesium concentrations than those    on diet alone (P<0.05). There were no independent associations between    serum magnesium or metformin therapy and either CHD or CVD at baseline.    Incident CVD, but not CHD, was independently and inversely associated    with serum magnesium (hazard ratio (95\% CI) 0.28 (0.11-0.74); P=0.010),    but metformin therapy was not a significant variable in these models.

Methods: We genotyped 7,379 Japanese participants (5,315 type 2 diabetes    and 2,064 controls) for each of the 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms    (SNPs), rs7041847 in GLIS3, rs6017317 in FITM2-R3HDML-HNF4A, rs6467136    near GCCI-PAX4, rs831571 near PSMD6, rs9470794 in ZFAND3, rs3786897 in    PEPD, rs1535500 in KCNK16, rs16955379 in CMIP, and rs17797882 near WWOX.

Results: With the exception of rs1535500 in KCNK16, all SNPs had the    same direction of effect (odds ratio {[}OR]>1.0) as in the original    reports.

We aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a    commonly-used diabetes case definition (two physician claims or one    hospital discharge abstract record within a two-year period) and their    potential effect on prevalence estimation.    Methods: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and    Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched Medline (from 1950) and    Embase (from 1980) databases for validation studies through August 2012    (keywords: ``diabetes mellitus''; ``administrative databases'';    ``validation studies''). Reviewers abstracted data with standardized    forms and assessed quality using Quality Assessment of Diagnostic    Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria. A generalized linear model approach    to random-effects bivariate regression meta-analysis was used to pool    sensitivity and specificity estimates. We applied correction factors    derived from pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates to prevalence    estimates from national surveillance reports and projected prevalence    estimates over 10 years (to 2018).    Results: The search strategy identified 1423 abstracts among which 11    studies were deemed relevant and reviewed; 6 of these reported    sensitivity and specificity allowing pooling in a meta-analysis.    Compared to surveys or medical records, sensitivity was 82.3\% (95\% CI    75.8, 87.4) and specificity was 97.9\% (95\% CI 96.5, 98.8). The    diabetes case definition underestimated prevalence when it was <= 10.6\%    and overestimated prevalence otherwise.    Conclusion: The diabetes case definition examined misses up to one fifth    of diabetes cases and wrongly identifies diabetes in approximately 2\%    of the population. This may be sufficiently sensitive and specific for    surveillance purposes, in particular monitoring prevalence trends.    Applying correction factors to adjust prevalence estimates from this    definition may be helpful to increase accuracy of estimates.}"ISI:000325864300002,"Guo, Xuan; Jin, Min; Yang, Ming; Liu, Ke & Li, Jun-wen",Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the Risk of Hepatitis C Virus Infection: A systematic review,{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},{3},,{OCT 18},,2013,,,,,,,,,"{The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between type 2    diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and to    examine whether T2DM enhances the risk of HCV infection compared with    the risk in the general population.

To date, significant efforts have been invested to develop    immune-modulatory therapies for T1D treatment. Previously, IL-2    immunotherapy was demonstrated to prevent and reverse T1D at onset in    the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, revealing potential as a    therapy in early disease stage in humans. In the NOD model, IL-2    deficiency contributes to a loss of regulatory T cell function. This    deficiency can be augmented with IL-2 or antibody bound to IL-2    (Ab/IL-2) therapy, resulting in regulatory T cell expansion and    potentiation. However, an understanding of the mechanism by which    reconstituted regulatory T cell function allows for reversal of diabetes    after onset is not clearly understood. Here, we describe that Ab/IL-2    immunotherapy treatment, given at the time of diabetes onset in NOD    mice, not only correlated with reversal of diabetes and expansion of    Treg cells, but also demonstrated the ability to significantly increase    beta cell proliferation. Proliferation appeared specific to Ab/IL-2    immunotherapy, as anti-CD3 therapy did not have a similar effect.    Furthermore, to assess the effect of Ab/IL-2 immunotherapy well after    the development of diabetes, we tested the effect of delaying treatment    for 4 weeks after diabetes onset, when beta cells were virtually absent.    At this late stage after diabetes onset, Ab/IL-2 treatment was not    sufficient to reverse hyperglycemia. However, it did promote survival in    the absence of exogenous insulin. Proliferation of beta cells could not    account for this improvement as few beta cells remained. Rather,    abnormal insulin and glucagon dual-expressing cells were the only    insulin-expressing cells observed in islets from mice with established    disease. Thus, these data suggest that in diabetic NOD mice, beta cells    have an innate capacity for regeneration both early and late in disease,    which is revealed through IL-2 immunotherapy.}"ISI:000326161300021,"Khooban, Mohammad Hassan; Abadi, Davood Nazari Maryam; Alfi, Alireza & Siahi, Mehdi",Swarm optimization tuned Mamdani fuzzy controller for diabetes delayed model,{TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES},{21},{1},,{2110-2126},2013,,,,,,,,,"{Diabetes is a chronic disease in which there are high levels of sugar in    the blood. Insulin is a hormone that regulates the blood glucose level    in the body. Diabetes mellitus can be caused by too little insulin, a    resistance to insulin, or both. Although research activities on    controlling blood glucose have been attempted to lower the blood glucose    level in the quickest possible time, there are some shortages in the    amount of the insulin injection. In this paper, a complete model of the    glucose insulin regulation system, which is a nonlinear delay    differential model, is used. The purpose of this paper is to follow the    glucose profiles of a healthy person with minimum infused insulin. To    achieve these purposes, an intelligent fuzzy controller based on a    Mamdani-type structure, namely the swarm optimization tuned Mamdani    fuzzy controller, is proposed for type 1 diabetic patients. The proposed    fuzzy controller is optimized by a novel heuristic algorithm, namely    linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization.

Research Design: Patients were individually randomized into intervention    (n = 103) and usual care group (n = 101). The primary outcome was change    in HbA(1c)-concentration after 12 and 18 months. Secondary outcomes were    lipid levels, blood pressure, health-related quality of life and    symptoms of depression. Follow-up-measurements were carried out after 6,    12 and 18 months to assess potential immediate and maintained effects of    the intervention. For the multivariate analysis, hierarchical linear    models were computed for each outcome to assess within-group changes in    outcomes over time and between-group differences in patterns of change.    Results: HbA(1c) (in \%) decreased significantly from baseline to    12-month follow-up measurement both in the intervention (-0.44) and the    usual care group (-0.51), but there was no significant between-group    intervention effect. Significant improvements in the intervention group    along with significant between-group differences were seen for    health-related quality of life and, transiently, for systolic blood    pressure and depression.    Conclusions: Although we found no beneficial effect of the supportive    telephone counseling in terms of a reduction of HbA1c above usual care,    our findings suggest some beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk    factors, quality of life and depression.

Analyzing infections and their spread in    healthy metabolite networks can be one of the focussed areas in this    regard. We have proposed a theory based on the classical forest fire    model for analyzing the path of infection spread in healthy metabolic    pathways. The theory suggests that when fire erupts in a forest, it    spreads, and the surrounding trees also catch fire. Similarly, when we    consider a metabolic network, the infection caused in the metabolites of    the network spreads like a fire. We have constructed a simulation model    which is used to study the infection caused in the metabolic networks    from the start of infection, to spread and ultimately combating it. For    implementation, we have used two approaches, first, based on    quantitative strategies using ordinary differential equations and    second, using graph-theory based properties. Furthermore, we are using    certain probabilistic scores to complete this task and for interpreting    the harm caused in the network, given by a `critical value' to check    whether the infection can be cured or not. We have tested our simulation    model on metabolic pathways involved in Type I Diabetes mellitus in Homo    sapiens. For validating our results biologically, we have used    sensitivity analysis, both local and global, as well as for identifying    the role of feedbacks in spreading infection in metabolic pathways.    Moreover, information in literature has also been used to validate the    results.

Study population: The exhaustive residing population treated for type 2    diabetes in Luxembourg during the 2000-2006 period (N = 21,068).    Methods: Seven fundamental criteria were extracted from international    guidelines (consultation with the treating physician, HbA1c tests,    electrocardiogram, retinal, dental, lipid and renal check-ups). The    factors associated with the level of adherence to those criteria were    identified using a partial proportional odds model.

Although heme-oxygenase (HO) is    cytoprotective, its effects on hepatocyte ballooning injury have not    been reported. We investigated the effects of upregulating HO with hemin    or inhibiting it with stannous-mesoporphyrin (SnMP) on hepatocyte    ballooning injury, hepatic adiposity and inflammation in    Zucker-diabetic-fatty rats (ZDFs), an obese type-2-diabetic model.

Correspondingly, hemin concomitantly    potentiated the protein expression of several markers of the    anti-inflammatory macrophage-M2-phenotype including ED2, IL-10 and    CD-206, alongside components of the HO-system including HO-1,    HO-activity and cGMP, whereas the HO-inhibitor, SnMP abolished the    effects.

Patients were categorized as never depressed    (Group 1), having had depression before diabetes diagnosis (Group 2),    diagnosed with depression and diabetes within 2 years of each other    (Group 3) and having depression after diabetes diagnosis (Group 4).    Results: Of 1391 patients, 20.8\% were assigned to Group 2, 6.0\% to    Group 3 and 14.5\% to Group 4. In Group 2, depression occurred a median    15.6 years before diabetes onset at age 37.2+/-14.7 years. These    patients had similar clinical characteristics to never depressed    patients except for reduced self-care behaviours and having more    symptomatic peripheral arterial disease. In Group 4, depression occurred    a median 9.9 years after diabetes onset at age 59.8+/-13.0 years.

Activation of AMPK results in    the mobilization of nutrient uptake and catabolism for mitochondrial ATP    generation to restore energy homeostasis. How these nutrient pathways    are affected in the presence of a potent modulator of mitochondrial    function and the role of AMPK activation in these effects remain    unclear. We have identified a molecule, named R419, that activates AMPK    in vitro via complex I inhibition at much lower concentrations than    metformin (IC50 100 nM vs 27 mM, respectively). R419 potently increased    myocyte glucose uptake that was dependent on AMPK activation, while its    ability to suppress hepatic glucose production in vitro was not. In    addition, R419 treatment of mouse primary hepatocytes increased fatty    acid oxidation and inhibited lipogenesis in an AMPK-dependent fashion.    We have performed an extensive metabolic characterization of its effects    in the db/db mouse diabetes model. In vivo metabolite profiling of    R419-treated db/db mice showed a clear upregulation of fatty acid    oxidation and catabolism of branched chain amino acids. Additionally,    analyses performed using both C-13-palmitate and C-13-glucose tracers    revealed that R419 induces complete oxidation of both glucose and    palmitate to CO2 in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue,    confirming that the compound increases mitochondrial function in vivo.    Taken together, our results show that R419 is a potent inhibitor of    complex I and modulates mitochondrial function in vitro and in diabetic    animals in vivo. R419 may serve as a valuable molecular tool for    investigating the impact of modulating mitochondrial function on    nutrient metabolism in multiple tissues and on glucose and lipid    homeostasis in diabetic animal models.}"ISI:000328730300004,"Al Mamun, Abdullah; Mannan, Munim; O'Callaghan, Michael J.; Williams, Gail M.; Najman, Jake M. & Callaway, Leonie K.",Association between Gestational Weight Gain and Postpartum Diabetes: Evidence from a Community Based Large Cohort Study,{PLOS ONE},{8},{12},{DEC 11},,2013,,,,,,,,,"{We have investigated the prospective association between excess    gestational weight gain (GWG) and development of diabetes by 21 years    post-partum using a community-based large prospective cohort study in    Brisbane, Australia.

Community based    prevalence data on DM and prediabetes (pre-DM) among TB patients is    lacking, particularly from the developing world. Therefore we conducted    a prospective study to investigate the prevalence of DM and pre-DM and    evaluated the risk factors for the presence of DM among newly detected    PTB patients in rural areas of China.    Methods and Findings: In a prospective community based study carried out    from 2010 to 2012, a representative sample of 6382 newly detected PTB    patients from 7 TB clinics in Linyi were tested for DM. A population of    6674 non-TB controls from the same community was similarly tested as    well. The prevalence of DM in TB patients (6.3\%) was higher than that    in non-TB controls (4.7\%, p < 0.05). PTB patients had a higher odds of    DM than non-TB controls (adjusted OR 3.17, 95\% CI 1.14-8.84). The    prevalence of DM increased with age and was significantly higher in TB    patients in the age categories above 30 years (p < 0.05). Among TB    patients, those with normal weight (BMI 18.5-23.9) had the lowest    prevalence of DM (5.8\%). Increasing age, family history of DM, positive    sputum smear, cavity on chest X-ray and higher yearly income (>= 10000    RMB yuan) were positively associated and frequent outdoor activity was    negatively associated with DM in PTB patients.    Conclusions: The prevalence of DM in PTB patients was higher than in    non-TB controls with a 3 fold higher adjusted odds ratio of having DM.

We utilized binary logistic    regression and stepwise logistic regression to investigate the    associations among DM, hypertension, fatty liver, cirrhosis, gallstone,    HBV infection, HCV infection, and HCC.    Results: Statistical analysis through the stepwise regression model    indicated that the prevalence of DM, male gender, cirrhosis, HCV    infection, or HBV infection is higher in the HCC patient group compared    to the control group. However, the prevalence of gallstone is negatively    associated with HCC cases. DM co-exists with HBV infection, male gender,    and age in the HCC cases. Binary logistic regression analysis suggested    that DM may synergize with HBV infection in HCC development.    Conclusion: DM is strongly associated with the increased risk of HCC    regardless of the prevalence of HBV infection, HCV infection, cirrhosis,    male gender, and age. However, the synergistic interaction between DM    and HBV in HCC occurrence is significant. Therefore, DM patients with    HBV infection represent a very high HCC risk population and should be    considered for HCC close surveillance program.}"ISI:000329325200098,"Cizmeci, Deniz & Arkun, Yaman",Regulatory Networks and Complex Interactions between the Insulin and Angiotensin II Signalling Systems: Models and Implications for Hypertension and Diabetes,{PLOS ONE},{8},{12},{DEC 31},,2013,,,,,,,,,"{The cross-talk between insulin and angiotensin II signalling pathways    plays a significant role in the co-occurrence of diabetes and    hypertension.

After Cox proportional hazard regression model    analysis, DM (hazard ratio {[}HR], 1.76; 95\% confidence interval    {[}CI], 1.50-2.07, p<0.001), age (HR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.10-1.12,    p<0.001), female gender (HR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.06-1.46, p=0.008),    hypertension (HR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.59, p=0.01), previous stroke    history (HR, 1.79; 95\% CI, 1.28-2.50, p<0.001), and urbanization status    (metropolis, HR, 1.32; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.63, p=0.009) were independently    associated with the increased risk of AD. Neither monotherapy nor    combination therapy with oral antidiabetic medications were associated    with the risk of AD after adjusting for underlying risk factors and the    duration of DM since diagnosis. However, combination therapy with    insulin was found to be associated with greater risk of AD (HR, 2.17;    95\% CI, 1.04-4.52, p=0.039).    Conclusion: Newly diagnosed DM was associated with increased risk of AD.    Use of hypoglycemic agents did not ameliorate the risk.}"ISI:000330617100119,"Konda, Veera R.; Desai, Anuradha; Darland, Gary; Grayson, Neile & Bland, Jeffrey S.","KDT501, a Derivative from Hops, Normalizes Glucose Metabolism and Body Weight in Rodent Models of Diabetes",{PLOS ONE},{9},{1},{JAN 30},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Aims/Hypothesis: We developed KDT501, a novel substituted    1,3-cyclopentadione chemically derived from hop extracts, and evaluated    it in various in vitro and in vivo models of diabetes and insulin    sensitivity.    Methods: KDT501 was evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects in    monocyte/macrophage cells; agonistic activity for peroxisome    proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR); lipogenesis and gene expression    profile in human subcutaneous adipocytes. Body composition, glucose,    insulin sensitivity, and lipids were assessed in diet-induced obesity    (DIO) mice and Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats after oral    administration.    Results: KDT501 mediated lipogenesis in 3T3L1 and human subcutaneous    adipocytes; however, the gene expression profile of KDT501 differed from    that of the full PPAR gamma agonist rosiglitazone, suggesting that    KDT501 has pleiotropic biological activities. In addition, KDT501 showed    only modest, partial PPAR gamma agonist activity and exhibited    anti-inflammatory effects in monocytes/macrophages that were not    observed with rosiglitazone. In a DIO mouse model, oral administration    of KDT501 significantly reduced fed blood glucose, glucose/insulin AUC    following an oral glucose bolus, and body fat. In ZDF rats, oral    administration of KDT501 significantly reduced fed glucose, fasting    plasma glucose, and glucose AUC after an oral glucose bolus.    Significant, dose-dependent reductions of plasma hemoglobin A1c, weight    gain, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were also observed in animals    receiving KDT501.    Conclusion: These results indicate that KDT501 produces a unique    anti-diabetic profile that is distinct in its spectrum of    pharmacological effects and biological mechanism from both metformin and    pioglitazone.

We tested whether previously identified    T2D-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) replicate and    whether SNPs in regions near known T2D SNPs were associated with T2D    within the Singapore Chinese Health Study.    Methods: 2338 cases and 2339 T2D controls from the Singapore Chinese    Health Study were genotyped for 507,509 SNPs. Imputation extended the    genotyped SNPs to 7,514,461 with high estimated certainty (r(2).0.8).    Replication of known index SNP associations in T2D was attempted. Risk    scores were computed as the sum of index risk alleles. SNPs in regions    +/- 100 kb around each index were tested for associations with T2D in    conditional fine-mapping analysis.    Results: Of 69 index SNPs, 20 were genotyped directly and genotypes at    35 others were well imputed. Among the 55 SNPs with data, disease    associations were replicated (at p<0.05) for 15 SNPs, while 32 more were    directionally consistent with previous reports. Risk score was a    significant predictor with a 2.03 fold higher risk CI (1.69-2.44) of T2D    comparing the highest to lowest quintile of risk allele burden (p = 5.72    x 10(-14)). Two improved SNPs around index rs10923931 and 5 new    candidate SNPs around indices rs10965250 and rs1111875 passed simple    Bonferroni corrections for significance in conditional analysis.    Nonetheless, only a small fraction (2.3\% on the disease liability    scale) of T2D burden in Singapore is explained by these SNPs.    Conclusions: While diabetes risk in Singapore Chinese involves genetic    variants, most disease risk remains unexplained. Further genetic work is    ongoing in the Singapore Chinese population to identify unique common    variants not already seen in earlier studies. However rapid increases in    T2D risk have occurred in recent decades in this population, indicating    that dynamic environmental influences and possibly gene by environment    interactions complicate the genetic architecture of this disease.}"ISI:000331711900103,"Jujic, Amra; Nilsson, Peter M.; Engstrom, Gunnar; Hedblad, Bo; Melander, Olle & Magnusson, Martin",Atrial Natriuretic Peptide and Type 2 Diabetes Development - Biomarker and Genotype Association Study,{PLOS ONE},{9},{2},{FEB 19},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Background: We have recently shown that low plasma levels of    mid-regional atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-ANP) predict development of    diabetes and glucose progression over time, independently of known risk    factors for diabetes development.

CIDP-DM patients were selected using age and    gender matching with the existing CIDP+DM cohort. Patients treated with    immunotherapies were classified as responders (R) (n = 46) or    non-responders (NR) (n = 54) based on clinical response to treatment.    The groups were compared using analysis of variance, contingency tables    and Kruskal-Wallis analyses.

Methodology: A total of 54,670 patients with    type 2 diabetes aged >= 25 years were selected from the Saudi National    Diabetes Registry (SNDR) and analyzed for the presence of diabetic    nephropathy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) criterion was used    to identify cases with microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria and end stage    renal disease (ESRD) for prevalence estimation and risk factor    assessment. Results: The overall prevalence of diabetic nephropathy was    10.8\%, divided into 1.2\% microalbuminuria, 8.1\% macroalbuninuria and    1.5\% ESRD.

Diabetes duration, retinopathy, neuropathy, hypertension, age >= 45    years, hyperlipidemia, male gender, smoking, and chronologically, poor    glycemic control has a significantly high risk for diabetic nephropathy.    Conclusion: The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy is underestimated as    a result of a shortage of screening programs. Risk factors related to    diabetic nephropathy in this society are similar to other societies.    There is thus an urgent need for screening and prevention programs for    diabetic nephropathy among the Saudi population.}"ISI:000331880700102,"Rylander, Charlotta; Sandanger, Torkjel M.; Engeset, Dagrun & Lund, Eiliv",Consumption of Lean Fish Reduces the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Prospective Population Based Cohort Study of Norwegian Women,{PLOS ONE},{9},{2},{FEB 24},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Background: The effects of fish consumption and n-3 fatty acids on type    2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have recently been debated.

The    purpose of this study was to investigate tendon mechanical properties    from normal and diabetic rats at two distinct length scales, testing the    hypothesis that increased stiffness and strength and decreased toughness    at the fiber level would be associated with alterations in nanoscale    morphology and mechanics. Individual fascicles from female Zucker    diabetic Sprague-Dawley (ZDSD) rats had no differences in fascicle-level    mechanical properties but had increased material-level strength and    stiffness versus control rats (CD).

In    multivariate models, the odds ratios of hepatic steatosis were 1.20    (95\% CI 1.15-1.25) in men and 1.25 (95\% CI 1.14-1.37) in women by each    unit increase in the combination of diabetes risk factors score, after    adjustment for blood pressure, liver enzymes, plasma lipids, and fasting    glucose. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for    hepatic steatosis was 0.78 (95\% CI 0.76-0.80), 0.76 in men (95\% CI    0.74-0.78) and 0.83 (95\% CI 0.79-0.87) in women.

One plausible mechanism is    enhanced expression and activity of the innate immune system. Therefore,    we evaluated the expression and the function of the toll-like receptor 4    (TLR4) on pancreatic beta-cells in primary mouse islets and on the    murine beta-cell line MIN6 in the presence or absence of macrophages.    Diabetic islets have 40\% fewer TLR4 positive beta-cells, but twice the    number of TLR4 positive macrophages as compared to healthy islets.    Healthy and diabetic islets respond to a TLR4 challenge with enhanced    production of cytokines (5-10-fold), while the TLR4 negative beta-cell    line MIN6 fails to produce cytokines. TLR4 stimulation induces beta-cell    dysfunction in mouse islets, measured as reduced glucose stimulated    insulin secretion. Diabetic macrophages from 4-months old mice have    acquired a transient enhanced capacity to produce cytokines when    stimulated with LPS. Interestingly, this is lost in 6-months old    diabetic mice. TLR4 activation alone does not induce apoptosis in islets    or MIN-6 cells. In contrast, macrophages mediate TLR4-dependent    cell-contact dependent (3-fold) as well as cell-contact independent    (2-fold) apoptosis of both islets and MIN-6 cells. Importantly, diabetic    macrophages have a significantly enhanced capacity to induce beta-cell    apoptosis compared to healthy macrophages. Taken together, the TLR4    responsiveness is elevated in the diabetic islets and mainly mediated by    newly recruited macrophages. The TLR4 positive macrophages, in both a    cell-contact dependent and independent manner, induce apoptosis of    beta-cells in a TLR4 dependent fashion and TLR4 activation directly    induces beta-cell dysfunction. Thus, targeting either the TLR4 pathway    or the macrophages provides a novel attractive treatment regime for T2D.}"ISI:000332485800002,"Ye, Zhen; Cong, Liming; Ding, Gangqiang; Yu, Min; Zhang, Xinwei; Hu, Ruying; Wu, Jianjun; Fang, Le; Wang, Hao; Zhang, Jie; He, Qingfang; Su, Danting; Zhao, Ming; Wang, Lixin; Gong, Weiwei; Xiao, Yuanyuan; Liang, Mingbin & Pan, Jin",Optimal Cut-Off Points for Two-Step Strategy in Screening of Undiagnosed Diabetes: A Population-Based Study in China,{PLOS ONE},{9},{3},{MAR 7},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{To identify optimal cut-off points of fasting plasma glucose for    two-step strategy in screening of undiagnosed diabetes in Chinese    people, data were selected from two cross-sectional studies of Metabolic    Syndrome in Zhejiang Province of China, Zhejiang Statistical Yearbook    (2010), and published literatures.

While some secondary complications of T2D are    well recognized and their cellular and molecular mechanisms are defined,    the impact of T2D on the musculoskeletal system is less understood.    Clinical evidence suggests that tendon strength and repair are    compromised. Here, a mouse model of obesity and T2D recapitulates the    deleterious effects of this condition on tendon repair.    Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice at 5 weeks of age were placed on a high fat    (HF)(60\% kcal) or low fat (10\% kcal) diet for 12 weeks. The flexor    digitorum longus (FDL) tendon was then injured by puncturing it with a    beveled needle. Progression of FDL tendon healing was assessed through    biomechanical and histological analysis at 0, 7, 14 and 28 days    post-injury.    Results: HF-fed mice displayed increased body weight and elevated    fasting glucose levels, both consistent with T2D. No differences in    biomechanical properties of the uninjured FDL tendon were observed after    12 weeks on HF versus lean diets, but decreased maximum force in    uninjured tendons from HF-fed mice was observed at 24 weeks. Following    puncture injury, tendons from HF-fed mice displayed impaired    biomechanical properties at day 28 post injury. In support of defective    repair in the HF-fed mice, histological examination of the injury site    showed a smaller area of repair and lower cell content in the repair    area of HF-fed mice. Insulin receptors were expressed in most cells at    the injury site regardless of diet.    Discussion: The HF-diet mouse model of obesity and T2D reproduces the    impaired tendon healing that is observed in this patient population. The    exact mechanism is unknown, but we hypothesize that a cellular defect,    perhaps involving insulin resistance, leads to decreased proliferation    or recruitment to the injury site, and ultimately contributes to    defective tendon healing.}"ISI:000333459900086,"Lee, Pin-Hui; Lin, Hui-Chen; Huang, Angela Song-En; Wei, Sung-Hsi; Lai, Mei-Shu & Lin, Hsien-Ho",Diabetes and Risk of Tuberculosis Relapse: Nationwide Nested Case-Control Study,{PLOS ONE},{9},{3},{MAR 24},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{The aim of this study was to investigate the association between    diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) relapse using the    nationwide TB registry in Taiwan.

Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with    streptozocin to induce diabetes. The diabetic rats were injected    intravitreally with alpha-MSH or saline. At week 5 after diabetes, the    retinas were analyzed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gene    expression. One week later, the retinas were processed for terminal    deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining and    transmission electron microscopy. Retinal vascular endothelial cells    were stimulated by high glucose (HG) with or without alpha-MSH. The    expression of Forkhead box O genes (Foxos) was examined through    real-time PCR. The Foxo4 gene was overexpressed in endothelial cells by    transient transfection prior to alpha-MSH or HG treatment, and oxidative    stress and apoptosis were analyzed through CM-H2DCFDA and annexin-V    assays, respectively.    Results: In diabetic retinas, the levels of H2O2 and ROS and the total    anti-oxidant capacity were normalized, the apoptotic cell number was    reduced, and the ultrastructural injuries were ameliorated by alpha-MSH.    Treatment with alpha-MSH also corrected the aberrant changes in eNOS,    iNOS, ICAM-1, and TNF-alpha expression levels in diabetic retinas.

Using competition-based population models of T-and B-cells,    we provide a predictive tool to determine how these two parametric    quantities, namely, avidity and killing efficacy, affect disease    outcomes. We show that, in the presence of T-cell competition,    successive waves along with cyclic fluctuations in the number of T-cells    are exhibited by the model, with the former induced by transient    bistability and the latter by transient periodic orbits. We hypothesize    that these two immunological processes are responsible for making T1D a    relapsing-remitting disease within prolonged but limited durations. The    period and the number of peaks of these two processes differ, making    them potential candidates to determine how plausible waves and cyclic    fluctuations are in producing such effects. By assuming that T-cell and    B-cell avidities are correlated, we demonstrate that autoantibodies    associated with the higher avidity T-cell clones are first to be    detected, and they reach their detectability level faster than those    associated with the low avidity clones, independent of what T-cell    killing efficacies are. Such outcomes are consistent with experimental    observations in humans and they provide a rationale for observing rapid    and slow progressors of T1D in high risk subjects. Our analysis of the    models also reveals that it is possible to improve disease outcomes by    unexpectedly increasing the avidity of certain subclones of T-cells. The    decline in the number of beta-cells in these cases still occurs, but it    terminates early, leaving sufficient number of functioning beta-cells in    operation and the affected individual asymptomatic.

The personalized model is evaluated    using data from the medical records of 12 patients with T1DM for the    time being on insulin pumps and CGMS. The obtained results demonstrate    the ability of the proposed model to capture the metabolic behavior of a    patient with T1DM and to handle intra-and inter-patient variability.}"ISI:000335217700094,"Dalakleidi, Kalliopi V.; Zarkogianni, Konstantia; Karamanos, Vassilios G.; Thanopoulou, Anastasia C. & Nikita, Konstantina S.",A Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for the Selection of the Critical Features for Risk Prediction of Cardiovascular Complications in Type 2 Diabetes Patients,,,,,,2013,,"{IEEE 13th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE), Chania, GREECE, NOV 10-13, 2013}",,{2013 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING (BIBE)},,,,,"{The purpose of this study is to present a hybrid approach based on the    combined use of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a nearest neighbours    classifier for the selection of the critical clinical features which are    strongly related with the incidence of fatal and non fatal    Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus    (T2DM).

Model-based insulin    therapy protocols have the ability to safely improve glycaemic control    for this group. Estimating non-insulin-mediated brain glucose uptake by    the central nervous system in these models is typically done using    population-based body weight models, which may not be ideal.    Method: A head circumference-based model that separately treats    small-for-gestational-age( SGA) and appropriate-for-gestational-age    (AGA) infants is compared to a body weight modelin a retrospective    analysis of 48 patients with a median birth weight of 750 g and median    gestational age of 25 weeks. Estimated brain mass, model-based insulin    sensitivity (S-I) profiles, and projected glycaemic control outcomes are    investigated. SGA infants (5) are also analyzed as a separate cohort.    Results: Across the entire cohort, estimated brain mass deviated by a    median 10\% between models, with a per-patient median difference in S-I    of 3.5\%. For the SGA group, brain mass deviation was 42\%, and    per-patient S-I deviation 13.7\%. In virtual trials, 87-93\% of    recommended insulin rates were equal or slightly reduced (Delta < 0.16    mU/h) under the head circumference method, while glycaemic control    outcomes showed little change.    Conclusion: The results suggest that body weight methods are not as    accurate as head circumference methods. Head circumference-based    estimates may offer improved modelling accuracy and a small reduction in    insulin administration, particularly for SGA infants. (C) 2014 Elsevier    Ireland Ltd.

Diet, sport activity, medical analysis or blood glucose    levels are some of them. This is a hard task, because some of these    controls are performed very often, for instance some diabetics measure    their glucose levels several times every day, or patients with chronic    renal disease, a progressive loss in renal function, should strictly    control their blood pressure and diet. In order to facilitate this task    to both the patient and the physician, we have developed a web    application for chronic diseases control which we have particularized to    diabetes. This system, called glUCModel, improves the communication and    interaction between patients and doctors, and eventually the quality of    life of the former. Through a web application, patients can upload their    personal and medical data, which are stored in a centralized database.    In this way, doctors can consult this information and have a better    control over patient records. glUCModel also presents three novelties in    the disease management: a recommender system, an e-learning course and a    module for automatic generation of glucose levels model. The recommender    system uses Case Based Reasoning. It provides automatic recommendations    to the patient, based on the recorded data and physician preferences, to    improve their habits and knowledge about the disease. The e-learning    course provides patients a space to consult information about the    illness, and also to assess their own knowledge about the disease. Blood    glucose levels are modeled by means of evolutionary computation,    allowing to predict glucose levels using particular features of each    patient. glUCModel was developed as a system where a web layer allows    the access of the users from any device connected to the Internet, like    desktop computers, tablets or mobile phones.

Design and methods: A prospective cohort was studied comprising 207    pregnant women, 129 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 78 with    gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and their offspring. Activin A,    follistatin and FSTL3 levels were measured in maternal serum collected    in the early third trimester of pregnancy. Serial fetal ultrasounds were    performed during the third trimester to evaluate fetal growth. Neonatal    anthropometry was measured to assess neonatal adiposity.

Post critical insult, levels of    counter-regulatory hormones are significantly elevated, but decrease    rapidly over the first 12-48 hours in the intensive care unit (ICU).    These hormones have a direct physiological impact on insulin sensitivity    (SI). Understanding the variability of SI is important for safely    managing glycaemic levels and understanding the evolution of patient    condition. The objective of this study is to assess the evolution of SI    over the first two days of ICU stay, and using this data, propose a    separate stochastic model to reduce the impact of SI variability during    glycaemic control using the STAR glycaemic control protocol.    Methods: The value of SI was identified hourly for each patient using a    validated physiological model. Variability of SI was then calculated as    the hour-to-hour percentage change in SI. SI was examined using 6 hour    blocks of SI to display trends while mitigating the effects of noise. To    reduce the impact of SI variability on achieving glycaemic control a new    stochastic model for the most variable period, 0-18 hours, was    generated. Virtual simulations were conducted using an existing    glycaemic control protocol (STAR) to investigate the clinical impact of    using this separate stochastic model during this period of increased    metabolic variability.    Results: For the first 18 hours, over 80\% of all SI values were less    than 0.5 Chi 10(-3) L/mU. min, compared to 65\% for > 18 hours. Using    the new stochastic model for the first 18 hours of ICU stay reduced the    number of hypoglycaemic measurements during virtual trials. For time    spent below 4.4, 4.0, and 3.0 mmol/L absolute reductions of 1.1\%, 0.8\%    and 0.1\% were achieved, respectively. No severe hypoglycaemic events    (BG < 2.2 mmol/L) occurred for either case.    Conclusions: SI levels increase significantly, while variability    decreases during the first 18 hours of a patients stay in ICU. Virtual    trials, using a separate stochastic model for this period, demonstrated    a reduction in variability and hypoglycaemia during the first 18 hours    without adversely affecting the overall level of control.

The main outcome was the centre patients'    mean HbA1c levels, but other clinical variables and change concepts were    also studied. Data from the previous six months were compared with the    first six months after starting the program, and the long-term follow up    after another eleven months.    Results: All centres reduced mean HbA1c during the second and third    periods compared with the first. The mean reduction for all was 3.7    mmol/mol (p<0.001), compared with non-participating centres who improved    their mean HbA1c with 1.7 mmol/mol during the same period. Many of the    participating centres reduced the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia    and/or ketoacidosis, and five centres reached their goal of ensuring    that all patients had some sort of physical activity at least once    weekly. Change concepts were, for example, improved guidelines,    appointment planning, informing the patients, improving teamwork and    active use of the registry, and health promotion activities.    Conclusions: By involving paediatric diabetes teams in a quality    improvement collaborative together with access to a quality register,    the quality of paediatric diabetes care can improve, thereby    contributing to a reduced risk of late complications for children and    adolescents with diabetes.}"ISI:000336922600103,"Magee, Matthew J.; Kempker, Russell R.; Kipiani, Maia; Tukvadze, Nestani; Howards, Penelope P.; Narayan, K.

The primary    aim was to estimate the association between DM and rate of TB sputum    culture conversion. A secondary objective was to estimate the    association between DM and the risk of poor treatment outcomes among    patients with MDR-TB.    Materials and Methods: A cohort of all adult patients starting MDR-TB    treatment in the country of Georgia between 20092011 was followed during    second-line TB therapy. Cox proportional models were used to estimate    the adjusted hazard rate of sputum culture conversion. Log-binomial    regression models were used to estimate the cumulative risk of poor TB    treatment outcome.    Results: Among 1,366 patients with sputum culture conversion    information, 966 (70.7\%) had culture conversion and the median time to    conversion was 68 days (interquartile range 50-120).

Methods: We analyzed the effects of 24 risk genetic variants with    reported associations from European GWAS in 3,040 Han Chinese subjects    in Taiwan (including 1,520 T2DM cases and 1,520 controls). The    discriminative power of the prediction models with and without genotype    scores was compared. We further meta-analyzed the association of these    variants with T2DM by pooling all candidate-gene association studies    conducted in Han Chinese.    Results: Five risk variants in IGF2BP2 (rs4402960, rs1470579), CDKAL1    (rs10946398), SLC30A8 (rs13266634), and HHEX (rs1111875) genes were    nominally associated with T2DM in our samples. The odds ratio was 2.22    (95\% confidence interval, 1.81-2.73, P<0.0001) for subjects with the    highest genetic score quartile (score>34) as compared with subjects with    the lowest quartile (score<29). The incoporation of genotype score into    the predictive model increased the C-statistics from 0.627 to 0.657    (P<0.0001). These estimates are very close to those observed in European    populations. Gene-environment interaction analysis showed a significant    interaction between rs13266634 in SLC30A8 gene and age on T2DM risk    (P<0.0001).

This was a 2-year follow-up study that included    132 patients with T2DM and 170 non-diabetic subjects. The serum vaspin    and adiponectin levels were determined with ELISA. Anthropometric    measurements, circulating glucose, hemoglobin A1c, insulin level, liver    function, kidney function, and lipid profile were measured for each    participant. The new onset of T2DM was counted in nondiabetic subjects    and the glycemic control was analyzed in T2DM patients at follow-up.

A Qualitative Study,{PLOS ONE},{9},{4},{APR 14},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Objective: Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent and can lead to serious    complications and mortality. Patient education can help to avoid    negative outcomes, but up to half of the patients do not participate.    The aim of this study was to analyze patients' attitudes towards    diabetes education in order to identify barriers to participation and    develop strategies for better patient education.    Methods: We conducted a qualitative study. Seven GP practices were    purposively selected based on socio-demographic data of city districts    in Hamburg, Germany. Study participants were selected by their GPs in    order to increase participation. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews    were conducted with 14 patients. Interviews were audiotaped and    transcribed verbatim. The sample size was determined by data saturation.    Data were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Categories were    determined deductively and inductively.    Results: The interviews yielded four types of barriers: 1) Statements    and behaviour of the attending physician influence the patients'    decisions about diabetes education. 2) Both, a good state of health    related to diabetes and physical/psychosocial comorbidity can be reasons    for non-participation. 3) Manifold motivational factors were discussed.    They ranged from giving low priority to diabetes to avoidance of    implications of diabetes education as being confronted with illness    narratives of others. 4) Barriers also include aspects of the patients'    knowledge and activity.    Conclusions: First, physicians should encourage patients to participate    in diabetes education and argue that they can profit even if actual    treatment and examination results are promising. Second, patients with    other priorities, psychic comorbidity or functional limitations might    profit more from continuous individualized education adapted to their    specific situation instead of group education. Third, it might be    justified that patients do not participate in diabetes education if they    have slightly increased blood sugar values only and no risk for harmful    consequences or if they already have sufficient knowledge on diabetes.}"ISI:000337154000005,"Pagkalos, Ilias; Herrero, Pau; Toumazou, Christofer & Georgiou, Pantelis",Bio-Inspired Glucose Control in Diabetes Based on an Analogue Implementation of a beta-Cell Model,{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS},{8},{2},{APR},{186-195},2014,,,,,,,,,"{This paper presents a bio-inspired method for in-vivo control of blood    glucose based on a model of the pancreatic beta-cell.

Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice at 5 weeks of age were placed on either a    control lean diet or an experimental high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. A    mid-diaphyseal open tibia was induced at 17 weeks of age and a spinal    needle was used for intra-medullary fixation. Mice were sacrificed at    days 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 35 for micro-computed tomography (mu CT),    histology-based histomorphometry and molecular analyses, and    biomechanical testing.    Results: HFD-fed mice displayed increased body weight and impaired    glucose tolerance, both characteristic of T2DM. Compared to control    mice, HFD-fed mice with tibia fractures showed significantly (p < 0.001)    decreased woven bone at day 28 by histomorphometry and significantly    (p<0.01) decreased callus bone volume at day 21 by mu CT. Interestingly,    fracture calluses contained markedly increased adiposity in HFD-fed mice    at days 21, 28, and 35. HFD-fed mice also showed increased PPAR gamma    immunohistochemical staining at day 14. Finally, calluses from HFD-fed    mice at day 35 showed significantly (p<0.01) reduced torsional rigidity    compared to controls.    Discussion: Our murine model of T2DM demonstrated delayed fracture    healing and weakened biomechanical properties, and was distinctly    characterized by increased callus adiposity. This suggests altered    mesenchymal stem cell fate determination with a shift to the adipocyte    lineage at the expense of the osteoblast lineage. The up-regulation of    PPAR gamma in fracture calluses of HFD-fed mice is likely involved in    the proposed fate switching.}"ISI:000337494400006,"Deja, Rafal",Decision support system for treatment of children with diabetes type 1,,,,,{69-78},2013,,,,{INTERNET IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE AND SECURITY},,,,"Pikiewicz, P & Rostanski, M","{Globally, diabetes is one of the most fast growing diseases in the    world.

IG-1 significantly    stimulated glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and    rat isolated adipocytes dose-dependently. IG-2 significantly stimulated    lipogenesis in rat isolated adipocytes dose-dependently. IG-15 also    enhanced glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The    administration of IG-1 decreased plasma glucose, increased glycogen    content in liver and skeletal muscles and improved glucose tolerance in    C57B6N mice with normal diets. The administration of IG-1 decreased    plasma glucose in STZ-diabetic C57B6N mice. The treatment of IG-1    decreased plasma glucose, increased glycogen content in liver and    skeletal muscles and improved glucose tolerance in C57B6N mice with high    fat-diets and db/db mice. The long-term treatment of IG-1 decreased    plasma glucose and reduced food intake and body weight in C57B6N mice    with high fat-diets and ob/ob mice. Thus, IG-1 has insulin-mimicking    bioactivities and improves glucose tolerance in mice models of diabetes    with or without obesity.}"ISI:000338606900009,"Chen, Hui; Tan, Chao; Lin, Zan & Wu, Tong",The diagnostics of diabetes mellitus based on ensemble modeling and hair/urine element level analysis,{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE},{50},,{JUL 1},{70-75},2014,,,,,,,,,"{The aim of the present work focuses on exploring the feasibility of    analyzing the relationship between diabetes mellitus and several element    levels in hair/urine specimens by chemometrics.

It was found that the most obvious difference was the effect of age    on the level of zinc and iron. The decline of iron concentration with    age in hair was exactly consistent with the opposite trend in urine.    Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a tool for a preliminary    evaluation of the data. Both ensemble and single support vector machine    (SVM) algorithms were used as the classification tools. On average, the    accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of ensemble SVM models were 99\%,    100\%, 99\% and 97\%, 89\%, 99\% for hair and urine samples,    respectively. The findings indicate that hair samples are superior to    urine samples.

However, the lack of donor pancreases    greatly limits this approach. One approach to overcome the limited    supply of donor pancreases is to generate functional islets from human    embryonic stem cells (hESCs), a cell line with unlimited proliferative    capacity, through rapid directed differentiation. This study    investigated whether pancreatic insulin-producing cells (IPCs)    differentiated from hESCs could correct hyperglycemia in severe combined    immunodeficient (SCID)/non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model of    diabetes.    Methods: We generated pancreatic IPCs from two hESC lines, YT1 and YT2,    using an optimized four-stage differentiation protocol in a chemically    defined culture system. Then, about 5-7x10(6) differentiated cells were    transplanted into the epididymal fat pad of SCID/NOD mice (n = 20). The    control group were transplanted with undifferentiated hESCs (n = 6).    Graft survival and function were assessed using immunohistochemistry,    and measuring serum human C-peptide and blood glucose levels.    Results: The pancreatic IPCs were generated by the four-stage    differentiation protocol using hESCs. About 17.1\% of differentiated    cells expressed insulin, as determined by flow cytometry. These cells    secreted insulin/C-peptide following glucose stimulation, similarly to    adult human islets. Most of these IPCs co-expressed mature beta    cell-specific markers, including human C-peptide, GLUT2, PDX1, insulin,    and glucagon. After implantation into the epididymal fat pad of SCID/NOD    mice, the hESC-derived pancreatic IPCs corrected hyperglycemia for >= 8    weeks. None of the animals transplanted with pancreatic IPCs developed    tumors during the time. The mean survival of recipients was increased by    implanted IPCs as compared to implanted undifferentiated hESCs    (P<0.0001).

The purpose of this study is to perform a    systematic review with meta-analysis of existing head to head studies to    compare the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 analogues with DPP-4    inhibitors.    Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of    head-to-head studies to compare GLP-1 analogues with DPP-4 inhibitors in    the management of type 2 diabetes.

In the occupational setting, obesity was associated with shift work,    severe musculoskeletal pain, low influence, but also by good management,    fewer role conflicts and a positive work-life balance. Looking only at    non-smokers, removed the influence of age and pain. However, non-smokers    also had higher depression scores and more role conflicts.

We aimed to explore whether NLRP3 inflammasome activation    contributes to DCM and the mechanism involved.    Methods: Type 2 diabetic rat model was induced by high fat diet and low    dose streptozotocin. The characteristics of type 2 DCM were evaluated by    metabolic tests, echocardiography and histopathology. Gene silencing    therapy was used to investigate the role of NLRP3 in the pathogenesis of    DCM. High glucose treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes were used to determine the    mechanism by which NLRP3 modulated the DCM. The cell death in vitro was    detected by TUNEL and EthD-III staining. TXNIP-siRNA and pharmacological    inhibitors of ROS and NF-B were used to explore the mechanism of NLRP3    inflammasome activation. Results: Diabetic rats showed severe metabolic    disorder, cardiac inflammation, cell death, disorganized ultrastructure,    fibrosis and excessive activation of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated    speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC),    pro-caspase-1, activated caspase-1 and mature interleukin-1b (IL-1b).    Evidence for pyroptosis was found in vivo, and the caspase-1 dependent    pyroptosis was found in vitro. Silencing of NLRP3 in vivo did not    attenuate systemic metabolic disturbances. However, NLRP3 gene silencing    therapy ameliorated cardiac inflammation, pyroptosis, fibrosis and    cardiac function. Silencing of NLRP3 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes suppressed    pyroptosis under high glucose.

Inhibition of NF-kB reduced the activation of NLRP3    inflammasome. TXNIP-siRNA decreased the activation of caspase-1 and    IL-1b.    Conclusion: NLRP3 inflammasome contributed to the development of DCM.    NF-kB and TXNIP mediated the ROS-induced caspase-1 and IL-1b activation,    which are the effectors of NLRP3 inflammasome.

A total of 494,002 men and 502,948 women and without lung    cancer were followed for the annual cumulative incidence of lung cancer    in 2005, with calculation of the risk ratios between diabetic and    non-diabetic subjects. Logistic regression estimated the adjusted odds    ratios for risk factors.    Results: The trends increased significantly in both sexes (P<0.0001).    The sex-specific annual cumulative incidence increased with age in    either the diabetic or non-diabetic subjects, but the risk ratios    attenuated with age. In logistic regressions, diabetes was associated    with a significantly higher risk, with odds ratios (95\% confidence    interval) for diabetes duration <1, 1-3, 3-5 and >= 5 years versus    non-diabetes of 2.189 (1.498-3.200), 1.420 (1.014-1.988), 1.545    (1.132-2.109), and 1.329 (1.063-1.660), respectively. Such an    association was not related to a higher detection with chest X-ray    examination. Insulin use and medications including oral anti-diabetic    drugs, statin, fibrate, and anti-hypertensive agents were not    significantly associated with lung cancer. Age, male sex, and chronic    obstructive pulmonary disease were positively; but dyslipidemia, stroke    and higher socioeconomic status were negatively associated with lung    cancer.    Conclusions: Diabetes is significantly associated with a higher risk of    lung cancer, but insulin use does not increase the risk.}"ISI:000341271500049,"Bhojani, Upendra; Devedasan, Narayanan; Mishra, Arima; De Henauw, Stefaan; Kolsteren, Patrick & Criel, Bart",Health System Challenges in Organizing Quality Diabetes Care for Urban Poor in South India,{PLOS ONE},{9},{9},{SEP 4},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Background: Weak health systems in low-and middle-income countries are    recognized as the major constraint in responding to the rising burden of    chronic conditions. Despite recognition by global actors for the need    for research on health systems, little attention has been given to the    role played by local health systems. We aim to analyze a mixed local    health system to identify the main challenges in delivering quality care    for diabetes mellitus type 2.    Methods: We used the health system dynamics framework to analyze a    health system in KG Halli, a poor urban neighborhood in South India. We    conducted semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers located    in and around the neighborhood who provide care to diabetes patients:    three specialist and 13 non-specialist doctors, two pharmacists, and one    laboratory technician. Observations at the health facilities were    recorded in a field diary. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis.    Result: There is a lack of functional referral systems and a    considerable overlap in provision of outpatient care for diabetes across    the different levels of healthcare services in KG Halli. Inadequate use    of patients' medical records and lack of standard treatment protocols    affect clinical decision-making. The poor regulation of the private    sector, poor systemic coordination across healthcare providers and    healthcare delivery platforms, widespread practice of bribery and    absence of formal grievance redress platforms affect effective    leadership and governance. There appears to be a trust deficit among    patients and healthcare providers. The private sector, with a majority    of healthcare providers lacking adequate training, operates to maximize    profit, and healthcare for the poor is at best seen as charity.    Conclusions: Systemic impediments in local health systems hinder the    delivery of quality diabetes care to the urban poor. There is an urgent    need to address these weaknesses in order to improve care for diabetes    and other chronic conditions.}"ISI:000341303700033,"Sha, Sue; Devineni, Damayanthi; Ghosh, Atalanta; Polidori, David; Hompesch, Marcus; Arnolds, Sabine; Morrow, Linda; Spitzer, Heike; Demarest, Keith & Rothenberg, Paul","Pharmacodynamic Effects of Canagliflozin, a Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitor, from a Randomized Study in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes",{PLOS ONE},{9},{8},{AUG 28},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Introduction: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single    and multiple ascending-dose study evaluated the pharmacodynamic effects    and safety/tolerability of canagliflozin, a sodium glucose    co-transporter 2 inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes.    Methods: Patients (N = 116) discontinued their antihyperglycemic    medications 2 weeks before randomization. Patients received    canagliflozin 30, 100, 200, or 400 mg once daily or 300 mg twice daily,    or placebo at 2 study centers in the United States and Germany, or    canagliflozin 30 mg once daily or placebo at 1 study center in Korea,    while maintaining an isocaloric diet for 2 weeks. On Days -1, 1, and 16,    urinary glucose excretion (UGE), plasma glucose (PG), fasting PG (FPG),    and insulin were measured. The renal threshold for glucose (RTG) was    calculated from UGE, PG, and estimated glomerular filtration rate.    Safety was evaluated based on adverse event (AE) reports, vital signs,    electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, and physical    examinations.    Results: Canagliflozin increased UGE dose-dependently (similar to 80-120    g/day with canagliflozin >= 100 mg), with increases maintained over the    14-day dosing period with each dose. Canagliflozin dose-dependently    decreased RTG, with maximal reductions to similar to 4-5 mM (72-90    mg/dL). Canagliflozin also reduced FPG and 24-hour mean PG; glucose    reductions were seen on Day 1 and maintained over 2 weeks. Plasma    insulin reductions with canagliflozin were consistent with observed PG    reductions. Canagliflozin also reduced body weight. AEs were transient,    mild to moderate in intensity, and balanced across groups; 1    canagliflozin-treated female reported an episode of vaginal candidiasis.    Canagliflozin did not cause hypoglycemia, consistent with the RTG values    remaining above the hypoglycemia threshold. At Day 16, there were no    clinically meaningful changes in urine volume, urine electrolyte    excretion, renal function, or routine laboratory test values.

The effect of T2DM on liver, muscle, and fat in MKR mice was    first studied by microarray analysis and subsequently the changes in    gene expression of frank T2DM MKR mice versus healthy mice were applied    to the multi-tissue model to test the effect. Using the first    multi-tissue genome-scale model of all metabolic pathways in T2DM, we    found out that branched-chain amino acids' degradation and fatty acids    oxidation pathway is downregulated in T2DM MKR mice. Microarray data    showed low expression of genes in MKR mice versus healthy mice in the    degradation of branched-chain amino acids and fatty-acid oxidation    pathways. In addition, the flux balance analysis using the MCL    multi-tissue model showed that the degradation pathways of    branched-chain amino acid and fatty acid oxidation were significantly    downregulated in MKR mice versus healthy mice. Validation of the model    was performed using data derived from the literature regarding T2DM.    Microarray data was used in conjunction with the model to predict fluxes    of various other metabolic pathways in the T2DM mouse model and    alterations in a number of pathways were detected.

To follow up the previous observations, the    present study (referred as Study 2) investigated the possible role of    acetylation of FoxO1 and associated events in this therapeutic memory by    characterizing the pathways regulating the acetylation status during and    post-OA treatments. OA treatment (100 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, during OA    treatment) reduced hyperglycemia in T2D mice by similar to 87\% and this    effect was largely (similar to 70\%) maintained even 4 weeks after the    cessation of OA administration (post-OA treatment). During OA treatment,    the acetylation and phosphorylation of FoxO1 were markedly increased    (1.5 to 2.5-fold) while G6Pase expression was suppressed by similar to    80\%. Consistent with this, OA treatment reversed pyruvate intolerance    in high-fat fed mice. Histone acetyltransferase 1 (HAT1) content was    increased (>50\%) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 and 5 (not HDAC1)    were reduced by 30-50\%. The OA-induced changes in FoxO1, G6Pase, HAT1    and HDACs persisted during the post-OA treatment period when the    increased phosphorylation of AMPK, SIRT1 content and reduced liver    triglyceride had subsided. These results confirmed the ability of OA to    control hyperglycemia far beyond treatment period in T2D mice. Most    importantly, in the present study we demonstrated acetylation of FoxO1    in the liver is involved in OA-induced memory for the control of    hyperglycemia.

The plasma    concentrations of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP),    peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were    higher (p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively) and the ghrelin    concentration was lower (p<0.001) after the M-meal in healthy subjects.    In contrast, the concentrations of GIP, PYY and PP were significantly    lower after the M-meal in T2D patients (p<0.001). Compared with the    V-meal, the M-meal was associated with a larger increase in    lipoperoxidation in T2D patients (p<0.05).    Conclusion/Interpretation: Our results suggest that the diet composition    and the energy content, rather than the carbohydrate count, should be    important considerations for dietary management and demonstrate that    processed meat consumption is accompanied by impaired GIH responses and    increased oxidative stress marker levels in diabetic patients.}"ISI:000341940000024,"Syaifuddin, Muhammad & Anbananthen, Kalaiarasi Sonai Muthu",Framework: Diabetes Management System,,,,,{112-116},2013,,"{International Conference on Multimedia Signal Processing and Communication Technologies (IMPACT), Aligarh, INDIA, NOV 23-25, 2013}",,"{2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMEDIA, SIGNAL PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES (IMPACT)}",,,,,"{Diabetes mellitus is a disease with numerous complications.

Effective control of    diabetes depends on self-monitoring and self-care activities such as    blood glucose monitoring, appropriate diet and nutrition, exercise    regimen and medication administration strategies. Also, individuals have    to keep track of their overall health record - a holistic approach    instead of only monitoring their blood glucose reading.

However a significant proportion of them do not    undertake the recommended levels of activity. Whilst questionnaire-based    studies have examined barriers to exercise in people with T1DM, a formal    qualitative analysis of these barriers has not been undertaken. Our aims    were to explore attitudes, barriers and facilitators to exercise in    patients with T1DM.    Methodology: A purposeful sample of long standing T1DM patients were    invited to participate in this qualitative study. Twenty-six adults were    interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule to determine    their level of exercise and barriers to initiation and maintenance of an    exercise programme.    Principal findings: Six main barriers to exercise were identified: lack    of time and work related factors; access to facilities; lack of    motivation; embarrassment and body image; weather; and diabetes specific    barriers (low levels of knowledge about managing diabetes and its    complications around exercise). Four motivators to exercise were    identified: physical benefits from exercise; improvements in body image;    enjoyment and the social interaction of exercising at gym or in groups.    Three facilitators to exercise were identified: free or reduced    admission to gyms and pools, help with time management, and advice and    encouragement around managing diabetes for exercise.    Significance: Many of the barriers to exercise in people with T1DM are    shared with the non-diabetic population. The primary difference is the    requirement for education about the effect of exercise on diabetes    control and its complications. There was a preference for support to be    given on a one to one basis rather than in a group environment. This    suggests that with the addition of the above educational requirements,    one to one techniques that have been successful in increasing activity    in patients with other chronic disease and the general public should be    successful in increasing activity in patients with T1DM.}"ISI:000342984700002,"Lim, Yu-Mi; Lim, Hyejin; Hur, Kyu Yeon; Quan, Wenying; Lee, Hae-Youn; Cheon, Hwanju; Ryu, Dongryeol; Koo, Seung-Hoi; Kim, Hong Lim; Kim, Jin; Komatsu, Masaaki & Lee, Myung-Shik",Systemic autophagy insufficiency compromises adaptation to metabolic stress and facilitates progression from obesity to diabetes,{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},{5},,{SEP},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Despite growing interest in the relationship between autophagy and    systemic metabolism, how global changes in autophagy affect metabolism    remains unclear.

External validation of these models helps building trust    and satisfies demands from decision makers. We evaluated the external    validity of the IHE Cohort Model of Type 2 Diabetes; the impact of using    alternative macrovascular risk equations; and compared the results to    those from microsimulation models.    Methods: The external validity of the model was analysed from 12    clinical trials and observational studies by comparing 167 predicted    microvascular, macrovascular and mortality outcomes to the observed    study outcomes. Concordance was examined using visual inspection of    scatterplots and regression-based analysis, where an intercept of 0 and    a slope of 1 indicate perfect concordance. Additional subgroup analyses    were conducted on `dependent' vs. `independent' endpoints and    microvascular vs. macrovascular vs. mortality endpoints.    Results: Visual inspection indicates that the model predicts outcomes    well. The UKPDS-OM1 equations showed almost perfect concordance with    observed values (slope 0.996), whereas Swedish NDR (0.952) and UKPDS-OM2    (0.899) had a slight tendency to underestimate. The R 2 values were    uniformly high (>0.96). There were no major differences between    `dependent' and `independent' outcomes, nor for microvascular and    mortality outcomes. Macrovascular outcomes tended to be underestimated,    most so for UKPDS-OM2 and least so for NDR risk equations.    Conclusions: External validation indicates that the IHE Cohort Model of    Type 2 Diabetes has predictive accuracy in line with microsimulation    models, indicating that the trade-off in accuracy using cohort    simulation might not be that large. While the choice of risk equations    was seen to matter, each were associated with generally reasonable    results, indicating that the choice must reflect the specifics of the    application. The largest variation was observed for macrovascular    outcomes.

Materials and Methods: T2DM, coronary artery disease (CAD),    cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and peripheral artery disease (PAD) were    defined according to ICD-10 codes. We used the Healthcare Common    Procedure Coding System codes provided by HIRA to identify associated    procedures or surgeries. When calculating incidence, we excluded cases    with preexisting T2DM within two years before the index year. A Poisson    distribution was assumed when calculating 95\% confidence intervals for    prevalence and incidence rates.    Results: The prevalence of T2DM in Korean adults aged 20-89 years was    6.1-6.9\% and the annual incidence rates of T2DM ranged from    9.5-9.8/1,000 person-year (PY) during the study period. The incidence    rates of T2DM in men and women aged 20-49 years showed decreasing    patterns from 2009 to 2011 (P<0.001); by contrast, the incidence in    subjects aged 70-79 years showed increased patterns from 2009 to 2011    (P<0.001).

Considering the intersubject    variance of the components in breath, we build subject-specific    prediction models to improve the accuracy of BGL prediction. A total of    295 breath samples from healthy subjects and 279 samples from diabetic    subjects were collected to evaluate the performance of the system. The    sensitivity and specificity of diabetes screening are 91.51\% and    90.77\%, respectively. The mean relative absolute error for BGL    prediction is 21.7\%. Experiments show that the system is effective and    that the strategies adopted in the system can improve its accuracy.

Methods: We used questionnaire data from a Danish health survey and    identified presence of Type 2 DM and use of medications through medical    databases. We calculated age-and gender-standardized prevalence ratios    (PRs) of lifestyle factors according to Type 2 DM and different    glucose-lowering drugs.    Results: Of 21,637 survey participants aged 25-79 years, 680 (3\%) had    Type 2 DM (median age 63 years) with a median diabetes duration of 5    years. Participants with Type 2 DM had a substantially higher prevalence    of obesity (36\% vs. 13\%, PR: 3.1, 95\% confidence interval (CI):    2.8-3.6), yet more reported to eat a very healthy diet (25\% vs. 21\%,    PR: 1.2, 95\% CI: 1.0-1.4) and to exercise regularly (67\% vs. 53\%, PR:    1.3, 95\% CI: 1.2-1.4). Also, fewer were current smokers or had high    alcohol intake. When compared with metformin users, obesity was    substantially less prevalent in users of sulfonylurea (PR: 0.5, 95\% CI:    0.40-8), and insulin and analogues (PR: 0.4, 95\% CI: 0.3-0.7).

Nevertheless, many medical science    researchers believe that complex diseases are caused by a combination of    genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Detection of such    diseases becomes an issue because it is not free from false presumptions    and is accompanied by unpredictable effects. Given the greatly increased    amount of data gathered in medical databases, data mining has been used    widely in recent years to detect and improve the diagnosis of complex    diseases. However, past research showed that no single classifier can be    considered optimal for all problems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus    on employing multiple classifier systems to improve the accuracy of    detection for complex diseases, such as T2DM. We proposed a dynamic    weighted voting scheme called multiple factors weighted combination for    classifiers' decision combination. This method considers not only the    local and global accuracy but also the diversity among classifiers and    localized generalization error of each classifier. We evaluated our    method on two real T2DM data sets and other medical data sets. The    favorable results indicated that our proposed method significantly    outperforms individual classifiers and other fusion methods. (C) 2014    Elsevier Inc.

Empagliflozin, as a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor    (SGLT2i), offers a novel approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes    by enhancing urinary glucose excretion. The aim of the present study was    to test whether treatment with empagliflozin improves endothelial    dysfunction in type I diabetic rats via reduction of glucotoxicity and    associated vascular oxidative stress.    Methods: Type I diabetes in Wistar rats was induced by an intravenous    injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). One week after injection    empagliflozin (10 and 30 mg/kg/d) was administered via drinking water    for 7 weeks. Vascular function was assessed by isometric tension    recording, oxidative stress parameters by chemiluminescence and    fluorescence techniques, protein expression by Western blot, mRNA    expression by RT-PCR, and islet function by insulin ELISA in serum and    immunohistochemical staining of pancreatic tissue. Advanced glycation    end products (AGE) signaling was assessed by dot blot analysis and mRNA    expression of the AGE-receptor (RAGE).    Results: Treatment with empagliflozin reduced blood glucose levels,    normalized endothelial function (aortic rings) and reduced oxidative    stress in aortic vessels (dihydroethidium staining) and in blood    (phorbol ester/zymosan A-stimulated chemiluminescence) of diabetic rats.    Additionally, the pro-inflammatory phenotype and glucotoxicity (AGE/RAGE    signaling) in diabetic animals was reversed by SGLT2i therapy.

Urinary excretion of nephrin and    vascular endothelial growth factor may increase even in the    normoalbuminuria stage. In the course of diabetic nephropathy, the    proximal tubule may be involved in the uptake of urinary nephrin and    vascular endothelial growth factor.    Materials and Methods: Two groups of consecutive Type 2 diabetes    mellitus outpatients (38 normo-, 32 microalbuminuric) and 21 healthy    subjects were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and evaluated    concerning the relation of proximal tubule dysfunction with the podocyte    biomarkers excretion, assessed by ELISA methods.

In MODY patients, this mutation is heterozygous, and both mutant and    wild-type (WT) human insulin are produced simultaneously. However, the    patients often depend on administration of exogenous insulin. In this    study, we chemically synthesized the MODY mutant {[}GlnB22]-insulin and    characterized its biological and structural properties. The chemical    synthesis of this insulin analogue revealed that its folding ability is    severely impaired. In vitro and in vivo tests showed that its binding    affinity and biological activity are reduced (both approximately 20\%    that of human insulin). Comparison of the solution structure of    {[}GlnB22]-insulin with the solution structure of native human insulin    revealed that the most significant structural effect of the mutation is    distortion of the B20-B23 beta-turn, leading to liberation of the B    chain C-terminus from the protein core. The distortion of the B20-B23    beta-turn is caused by the extended conformational freedom of the GlnB22    side chain, which is no longer anchored in a hydrogen bonding network    like the native ArgB22. The partially disordered {[}GlnB22]-insulin    structure appears to be one reason for the reduced binding potency of    this mutant and may also be responsible for its low folding efficiency    in vivo. The altered orientation and flexibility of the B20-B23    beta-turn may interfere with the formation of disulfide bonds in    proinsulin bearing the R46Q (GlnB22) mutation. This may also have a    negative effect on the WT proinsulin simultaneously biosynthesized in    beta-cells and therefore play a major role in the development of MODY in    patients producing {[}GlnB22]-insulin.}"ISI:000346382500013,"Reifsnyder, Peter C.; Doty, Rosalinda & Harrison, David E.","Rapamycin Ameliorates Nephropathy despite Elevating Hyperglycemia in a Polygenic Mouse Model of Type 2 Diabetes, NONcNZO10/LtJ",{PLOS ONE},{9},{12},{DEC 4},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{While rapamycin treatment has been reported to have a putatively    negative effect on glucose homeostasis in mammals, it has not been    tested in polygenic models of type 2 diabetes.

Results: High and low metabolite concentrations were defined as top or    bottom quintile of the total cohort. In subjects with diabetes (n=79),    high plasma betaine was associated with increased frequencies of events;    significantly for heart failure, hazard ratio 3.1 (1.2-8.2) and all    cardiovascular events, HR 2.8 (1.4-5.5).

The hazard ratio (4th vs 1st    quartile) was 1.11 (95\% confidence interval 0.82-1.49), when adjusted    for potential confounders.    Conclusions: Elevated blood cadmium levels are not associated with    increased incidence of diabetes. The positive association between HbA1c    and blood cadmium levels has a likely explanation in mechanisms related    to erythrocyte turnover and smoking.}"ISI:000347709300141,"Klimentidis, Yann C.; Zhou, Jin & Wineinger, Nathan E.",Identification of Allelic Heterogeneity at Type-2 Diabetes Loci and Impact on Prediction,{PLOS ONE},{9},{11},{NOV 13},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Although over 60 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been    identified by meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for    type-2 diabetes (T2D) among individuals of European descent, much of the    genetic variation remains unexplained. There are likely many more SNPs    that contribute to variation in T2D risk, some of which may lie in the    regions surrounding established SNPs - a phenomenon often referred to as    allelic heterogeneity. Here, we use the summary statistics from the    DIAGRAM consortium meta-analysis of T2D genome-wide association studies    along with linkage disequilibrium patterns inferred from a large    reference sample to identify novel SNPs associated with T2D surrounding    each of the previously established risk loci. We then examine the extent    to which the use of these additional SNPs improves prediction of T2D    risk in an independent validation dataset. Our results suggest that    multiple SNPs at each of 3 loci contribute to T2D susceptibility    (TCF7L2, CDKN2A/8, and KCNO1; p<5 x10(-8)). Using a less stringent    threshold (p<5 x10(-4)), we identify 34 additional loci with multiple    associated SNPs. The addition of these SNPs slightly improves T2D    prediction compared to the use of only the respective lead SNPs, when    assessed using an independent validation cohort. Our findings suggest    that some currently established T2D risk loci likely harbor multiple    polymorphisms which contribute independently and collectively to T2D    risk. This opens a promising avenue for improving prediction of T2D, and    for a better understanding of the genetic architecture of T2D.}"ISI:000347709300145,"Bessho, Megumi; Murase-Mishiba, Yuko; Imagawa, Akihisa; Terasaki, Jungo & Hanafusa, Toshiaki",Possible Contribution of Taurine to Distorted Glucagon Secretion in Intra-Islet Insulin Deficiency: A Metabolome Analysis Using a Novel alpha-Cell Model of Insulin-Deficient Diabetes,{PLOS ONE},{9},{11},{NOV 13},,2014,,,,,,,,,"{Glycemic instability is a serious problem in patients with    insulin-deficient diabetes, and it may be due in part to abnormal    endogenous glucagon secretion. However, the intracellular metabolic    mechanism(s) involved in the aberrant glucagon response under the    condition of insulin deficiency has not yet been elucidated. To    investigate the metabolic traits that underlie the distortion of    glucagon secretion under insulin deficient conditions, we generated an    alpha TC1-6 cell line with stable knockdown of the insulin receptor    (IRKD), i.e., an in vitro alpha-cell model for insulin-deficient    diabetes, which exhibits an abnormal glucagon response to glucose. A    comprehensive metabolomic analysis of the IRKD alpha TC1-6 cells (IRKD    cells) revealed some candidate metabolites whose levels differed    markedly compared to those in control alpha TC1-6 cells, but also which    could affect the glucagon release in IRKD cells. Of these candidates,    taurine was remarkably increased in the IRKD cells and was identified as    a stimulator of glucagon in alpha TC1-6 cells. Taurine also    paradoxically exaggerated the glucagon secretion at a high glucose    concentration in IRKD cells and islets with IRKD. These results indicate    that the metabolic alterations induced by IRKD in alpha-cells,    especially the increase of taurine, may lead to the distorted glucagon    response in IRKD cells, suggesting the importance of taurine in the    paradoxical glucagon response and the resultant glucose instability in    insulin-deficient diabetes.}"ISI:000347779500015,"Pradhan, Madhavi & Bamnote, G.

Glycaemic control    (GC) can be implemented in the intensive care unit (ICU) to safely    manage hyperglycaemia. Two protocols SPRINT and STAR, have been    implemented in the Christchurch ICU, and have been successful in    treating hyperglycaemia while decreasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. This    paper presents a new GC protocol that implements the probabilistic,    stochastic forecasting methods of STAR, while formalizing the control    methodology using model predictive control (MPC) theory to improve the    ability to tune the dynamic response of the controller. This Stochastic    Model Predictive (STOMP) controller predicts the response to a given    insulin/nutrition intervention, and attributes weighted penalty values    to several key performance metrics. The controller thus chooses an    intervention at each hour that minimizes the sum of these penalties over    a prediction window of 6 h, which is twice as long as the 3-h window    used in STAR. Clinically validated virtual trials were used to evaluate    the relative performance of STOMP. Results showed STOMP was able to    obtain results very similar to STAR with both protocols maintaining    approximately 85\% of time within 4.4-8.0 mmol/L glycaemic band, and    only 4-5 patients of the 149 patient STAR cohort having blood glucose    (BG) <2.2 mmol/L. STOMP was able to attain similar results to STAR while    further increasing ease of controller tuning for different clinical    requirements and reducing the number of BG measurements required by    35\%.

Predicting BG is of very high importance as most treatments, which    consist in exogenous insulin injections, rely on the availability of BG    predictions. Many models that can be used for predicting BG are    available in the literature. However, it is widely admitted that it is    almost impossible to perfectly model blood glucose dynamics while still    being able to identify model parameters using only blood glucose    measurements. The main contribution of this work is to propose a simple    and identifiable linear dynamical model, which is based on the static    prediction model of standard therapy. It is shown that the model    parameters are intrinsically correlated with physician-set therapy    parameters and that the reduction of the number of model parameters to    identify leads to inferior data fits but to equivalent or slightly    improved prediction capabilities compared to state-of-the-art models: a    sign of an appropriate model structure and superior reliability. The    validation of the proposed dynamic model is performed using data from    the UVa simulator and real clinical data, and potential uses of the    proposed model for state estimation and BG control are discussed.

Currently,    clinicians and nurses mainly base their wound assessment on visual    examination of wound size and healing status, while the patients    themselves seldom have an opportunity to play an active role. Hence, a    more quantitative and cost-effective examination method that enables the    patients and their caregivers to take a more active role in daily wound    care potentially can accelerate wound healing, save travel cost and    reduce healthcare expenses. Considering the prevalence of smartphones    with a high-resolution digital camera, assessing wounds by analyzing    images of chronic foot ulcers is an attractive option. In this paper, we    propose a novel wound image analysis system implemented solely on the    Android smartphone. The wound image is captured by the camera on the    smartphone with the assistance of an image capture box. After that, the    smartphone performs wound segmentation by applying the accelerated    mean-shift algorithm. Specifically, the outline of the foot is    determined based on skin color, and the wound boundary is found using a    simple connected region detection method. Within the wound boundary, the    healing status is next assessed based on red-yellow-black color    evaluation model. Moreover, the healing status is quantitatively    assessed, based on trend analysis of time records for a given patient.

Efforts to make closed-loop    systems available to people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) calls for the    development of a new type of simulators to accommodate differences    between T1D and T2D. Presented here is the development of a model of    posthepatic endogenous insulin concentration, a component omitted in T1D    simulators but key for simulating T2D physiology.    Methods: We evaluated six competing models to describe the time course    of endogenous insulin concentration as a function of the plasma glucose    concentration and time. The models were fitted to data collected in    insulin-naive subjects with T2D who underwent two 24-h visits and were    treated, in a random order, by either closed-loop insulin delivery or    glucose-lowering oral agents. The model parameters were estimated using    a Bayesian approach, as implemented in the WinBUGS software. Model    selection criteria were used to identify the best model describing our    clinical data.    Results: The selected model successfully described endogenous insulin    concentration over 24 h in both study periods and provided plausible    parameter estimates. Model-derived results were in concordance with a    clinical finding which revealed increased posthepatic endogenous insulin    concentration during the control study period (P < 0.05). The modelling    results indicated that the excess amount of insulin can be attributed to    the glucose-independent effect as the glucose-dependent effect was    similar between visits (P > 0.05).    Conclusions: A model to describe endogenous insulin concentration in T2D    including components of posthepatic glucose-dependent and    glucose-independent insulin secretion was identified and validated.

In this study, we    retrospectively compared the rates of various maternal and neonatal    outcomes in all women who delivered after 24 weeks of gestation during    the periods before (P1, between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010)    and after (P2, between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013) the IADPSG    criteria were implemented. Pregnancies complicated by multiple    gestations, fetal chromosomal or structural anomalies, and pre-pregnancy    diabetes mellitus were excluded. Our results showed that the incidence    of GDM increased from 4.6\% using the two-step method to 12.4\% using    the IADPSG criteria. Compared to the women in P1, the women in P2    experienced less weight gain during pregnancy, lower birth weights,    shorter labor courses, and lower rates of macrosomia (< 4000 g) and    large-for-gestational age (LGA) infants. P2 was a significant    independent factor against macrosomia (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR] 0.63,    95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.43-0.90) and LGA (adjusted OR 0.74,    95\% CI 0.61-0.89) after multivariable logistic regression analysis.    Conclusions/Significance    The adoption of the IADPSG criteria for diagnosis of GDM was associated    with significant reductions in maternal weight gain during pregnancy,    birth weights, and the rates of macrosomia and LGA.}"ISI:000351425400155,"Zhang, Yurong; Hu, Gang; Zhang, Lu; Mayo, Rachel & Chen, Liwei",A Novel Testing Model for Opportunistic Screening of Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes,{PLOS ONE},{10},{3},{MAR 19},,2015,,,,,,,,,"{Objective    The study aim was to evaluate the performance of a novel simultaneous    testing model, based on the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and    HbA1c, in detecting undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes in Americans.

The FINDRISC was developed based    on eight variables (age, BMI, waist circumference, use of    antihypertensive drug, history of high blood glucose, family history of    diabetes, daily physical activity and fruit \& vegetable intake). The    sensitivity, specificity, and the receiver operating characteristic    (ROC) curve of the testing model were calculated for undiagnosed    diabetes and pre-diabetes, determined by oral glucose tolerance test    (OGTT).    Results    The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 7.0\% and 43.1\% for    pre-diabetes (27.7\% for isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 5.1\%    for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 10.3\% for having both IFG and    IGT). The sensitivity and specificity of using the HbA1c alone was    24.2\% and 99.6\% for diabetes (cutoff of >= 6.5\%), and 35.2\% and    86.4\% for prediabetes (cutoff of >= 5.7\%). The sensitivity and    specificity of using the FINDRISC alone (cutoff of >= 9) was 79.1\% and    48.6\% for diabetes and 60.2\% and 61.4\% for pre-diabetes. Using the    simultaneous testing model with a combination of FINDRISC and HbA1c    improved the sensitivity to 84.2\% for diabetes and 74.2\% for    pre-diabetes. The specificity for the simultaneous testing model was    48.4\% of diabetes and 53.0\% for pre-diabetes.

Growing evidence suggests a strong    link between circadian rhythms and energy metabolism; however, the    fundamental mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, neonatal    streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mice were used to model the molecular and    physiological progress from insulin resistance to diabetes. Two-day-old    male C57BL/6 mice received a single injection of STZ and were tested for    non-obese, hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic conditions in the early    stage, insulin resistance in the middle stage, and diabetes in the late    stage. Gene expression levels of the hepatic circadian-clock system were    examined by real-time quantitative PCR. Most of the components of the    hepatic circadian-clock gene expression system, such as the mRNAs of    Bmal1 (brain and muscle Arnt-like protein-1), Per2 (period 2) and Cry1    (cryptochrome 1), were elevated, and circadian patterns were retained in    the early and middle stages of insulin-resistant conditions. The insulin    sensitizer, rosiglitazone, returns the physiological and molecular    changes associated with the diabetic phenotype to normal levels through    peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) rather    than PPAR alpha. Early and chronic treatment with rosiglitazone has been    shown to be effective to counter the diabetic condition. Over time, this    effect acts to attenuate the increased gene expression levels of the    hepatic circadian-clock system and delay the severity of diabetic    conditions. Together, these results support an essential role for the    hepatic circadian-clock system in the coordinated regulation and/or    response of metabolic pathways.}"ISI:000351987300187,"Harder, Marie Neergaard; Appel, Emil Vincent Rosenbaum; Grarup, Niels; Gjesing, Anette Prior; Ahluwalia, Tarunveer S.; Jorgensen, Torben; Christensen, Cramer; Brandslund, Ivan; Linneberg, Allan; Sorensen, Thorkild I.

Methods    In 2010-2012, 18589 women who registered within 12 weeks of gestation    underwent a glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24-28 gestational weeks.    Amongst them, 2953 women with 1-hour plasma glucose >= 7.8 mmol/L    underwent a 75-gram 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and 781    women had a positive GCT but absented from the standard OGTT.

Methods    A historical cohort study using electronic medical record data obtained    between January 2008 and December 2013. A total of 52,781 individuals    with HbA(1c) < 6.5\% were assigned to one of six groups categorized by    baseline HbA(1c) level: <= 5.5\% (n=34,616), 5.6-5.7\% (n=9,388),    5.8-5.9\% (n= 4,664), 6.0-6.1\% (n=2,338), 6.2-6.3\% (n=1,257), and    6.4\% (n=518). Participants were tracked until a subsequent diagnosis of    diabetes or end of follow-up during a period of 5 years.    Results    During the follow-up period (mean 3.7 years), 4,369 participants    developed diabetes. The incidence of diabetes in the first year was 0.7,    1.5, 2.9, 9.2, 30.4, and 44.0\% in the six HbA(1c) groups, respectively.    At five years the incidence was 3.6, 8.9, 13.8, 27.5, 51.6, and 67.8\%,    respectively (p < 0.0001 comparing the HbA(1c) <= 5.5\% group to the    other groups). After adjustment for confounding factors, the hazard    ratios compared with the HbA(1c) <= 5.5\% group were significantly    elevated: 2.3 (95\% CI 2.0-2.5), 3.4 (95\% CI 2.9-3.7), 8.8 (95\% CI    8.0-10.1), 26.3 (95\% CI 23.3-30.1), and 48.7 (95\% CI 40.8-58.1) in the    five HbA(1c) groups (p < 0.0001).    Conclusion    By fractionating baseline HbA(1c) levels into narrower HbA(1c) range    groups, accuracy of estimating the incidence of type 2 diabetes in    subsequent years was increased.

Methods    Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with of D-glucose (10-100mM), and    NO levels and NOS gene expression was measured. Hyperglycaemia was    induced in Sprague-Dawley rats, and serum NO levels were measured after    8 weeks.

Subsequently, kidneys were harvested    from anethesized pigs and the expression levels of well-established    markers for microvascular integrity, such as Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt1) and    Angiopoietin-2 (Angpt2) were determined immunohistochemically, while    endothelial cell (EC) abundance was determined by immunostaining for von    Willebrand factor (vWF).    Results    Our study revealed an increase in the capillary tortuosity index in    DM+ATH pigs (2.31 +/- 0.17) as compared to the control groups (Controls    0.89 +/- 0.08 and ATH 1.55 +/- 0.11; p<0.05). Kidney biopsies showed    marked glomerular lesions consisting of mesangial expansion and podocyte    lesions. Furthermore, we observed a disturbed Angpt2/Angpt1balance in    the cortex of the kidney, as evidenced by increased expression of Angpt2    in DM+ATH pigs as compared to Control pigs (p<0.05).    Conclusion    In the setting of DM, atherogenesis leads to the augmentation of mucosal    capillary tortuosity, indicative of systemic microvascular damage.    Concomitantly, a dysbalance in renal angiopoietins was correlated with    the development of diabetic nephropathy. As such, our studies strongly    suggest that defects in the systemic microvasculature mirror the    accumulation of microvascular damage in the kidney.}"ISI:000353513400011,"Zhao, Chunhui & Yu, Chengxia",Rapid Model Identification for Online Subcutaneous Glucose Concentration Prediction for New Subjects With Type I Diabetes,{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING},{62},{5},{MAY},{1333-1344},2015,,,,,,,,,"{Goal: For conventional modeling methods, the work of model    identification has to be repeated with sufficient data for each subject    because different subjects may have different response to exogenous    inputs. This may cause repetitive cost and burden for patients and    clinicians and require a lot of modeling efforts. Here, to overcome the    aforementioned problems, a rapid model development strategy for new    subjects is proposed using the idea of model migration for online    glucose prediction. Methods: First, a base model is obtained that can be    empirically identified from any subject or constructed by a priori    knowledge. Then, parameters of inputs in the base model are properly    revised based on a small amount of new data from new subjects so that    the updated models can reflect the specific glucose dynamics excited by    inputs for new subjects. These problems are investigated by developing    autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) based on 30 in silico    subjects using UVA/Padova metabolic simulator. Results: The prediction    accuracy of the rapid modeling method is comparable to that for    subject-dependent modeling method for some cases. Also, it can present    better generalization ability. Conclusion: The proposed method can be    regarded as an effective and economic modeling method instead of    repetitive subject-dependent modeling method especially for lack of    modeling data.}"ISI:000353659100154,"Zhu, Chunyan; Yang, Hongling; Geng, Qingshan; Ma, Qingling; Long, Yan; Zhou, Cheng & Chen, Ming",Association of Oxidative Stress Biomarkers with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Pregnant Women: A Case-Control Study,{PLOS ONE},{10},{4},{APR 27},,2015,,,,,,,,,"{Objective    The relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and    oxidative stress has not been fully elucidated. This study examined the    association between biomarkers of oxidative stress and GDM.    Methods    We conducted a case-control study which included 36 women presenting    with GDM and 36 asymptomatic matched control subjects who visited    Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Centre, China, from June 2012 to    December 2012. Pregnant women were prospectively recruited to the study,    and blood samples were collected at the time of a routine oral glucose    tolerance test. These samples were then analyzed for levels of endocrine    and surrogate markers of oxidative stress.    Results    Compared to control subjects, women with GDM exhibited elevated values    for plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (IR), and showed    reduced HOMA pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-B), insulin sensitivity    index (ISI), insulinogenic index, and corrected insulin response at    24-28 weeks gestation. A bivariate logistic regression analysis showed    that levels of high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) and high    fluorescence reticulocytes at fasting, and hs-CRP in a 1-h OGTT, were    significantly associated with GDM. A linear regression analysis showed    that levels of hs-CRP (P = 0.003) and reticulocytes (P = 0.029) at    fasting were associated with IR, and levels of hs-CRP (P = 0.002) and    monocytes (P = 0.006) in a 1-h OGTT were associated with ISI.    Conclusions    Pregnant women with GDM developed a pathological IR and exhibited    beta-cell dysfunction.

The artificial pancreas system (APS) has been generally    considered as the ultimate cure of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The    simulation model of insulin-glucose metabolism is an essential part of    an APS as it processes the measured glucose level and generates control    signal to the insulin infusion system. This paper presents a new    insulin-glucose metabolic model using model reduction methods applied to    the popular but complex Cobelli's model. The performances of three    different model reduction methods, namely Pade approximation, Routh    approximation and system identification, are compared. The results of in    silico simulation based on 30 virtual patients of three groups for    adults, adolescents, and children show that the approximation error    between this new model and the original Cobelli's model is so small that    can be neglected. It can be concluded that the proposed simplified model    can describe the insulin-glucose metabolism process rather accurately as    well as can be easily implemented and integrated into an APS to make the    APS technology more mature and closer to clinical use. The FPGA    implementation, testing and further simplification possibility will be    explored in the next stage of research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, it is unclear to what degree good    glycemic control might mitigate these risks and clinical outcomes have    not previously been studied in relation to glucose from the lower    airways, the site of infection and CF disease progression. We initially    hypothesized that diabetic cystic fibrosis patients with glycosylated    hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) > 6.5\% have worse pulmonary function, longer and    more frequent exacerbations and also higher sputum glucose levels than    patients with HbA(1c) <= 6.5\% or cystic fibrosis patients without    diabetes. To test this, we analyzed spontaneously expectorated sputum    samples from 88 cystic fibrosis patients. The median sputum glucose    concentration was 0.70 mM (mean, 4.75 mM; range, 0-64.6 mM). Sputum    glucose was not correlated with age, sex, body mass index, diabetes    diagnosis, glycemic control, exacerbation frequency or length, or    pulmonary function. Surprisingly, sputum glucose was highest in subjects    with normal glucose tolerance, suggesting the dynamics of glycemic    control, sputum glucose and pulmonary infections are more complex than    previously thought. Two-year mean HbA(1c) was positively correlated with    the length of exacerbation admission (p < 0.01), and negatively    correlated with measures of pulmonary function (p < 0.01). While total    number of hospitalizations for exacerbations were not significantly    different, subjects with an HbA(1c) > 6.5\% were hospitalized on average    6 days longer than those with HbA(1c) <= 6.5\% (p < 0.01). Current    clinical care guidelines for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes target    HbA(1c) <= 7\% to limit long-term microvascular damage, but more    stringent glycemic control (HbA(1c) <= 6.5\%) may further reduce the    short-term pulmonary complications.}"ISI:000353932500022,"Wang, Kung-Jeng; Adrian, Angelia Melani; Chen, Kun-Huang & Wang, Kung-Min",An improved electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithm and its application to the prediction of diabetes mellitus,{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},{54},,{APR},{220-229},2015,,,,,,,,,"{Recently, the use of artificial intelligence based data mining    techniques for massive medical data classification and diagnosis has    gained its popularity, whereas the effectiveness and efficiency by    feature selection is worthy to further investigate.

Results    HTG subjects, either with or without statin, had higher prevalence of    albuminuria, reduced eGFR and chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially    the albuminuric forms, but not of retinopathy, than NTG subjects. In    contrast, cardiovascular disease and advanced DR were more prevalent in    subjects on statin than in those not, independently of triglyceride    levels. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that HTG, without or with    statin, was independently associated with micro and macroalbuminuria,    mildly to severely reduced eGFR, and all CKD phenotypes, but not with    retinopathy.

It is still debated if vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor or a    prognostic marker for mortality in these patients. This study    investigated the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its impact on    all-cause mortality in HD patients with DM.    Methods    Our prospective non-interventional cohort study included 600 patients on    hemodialysis therapy (HD) (median aged 56, interquartile range (19)    years, 332 (55.3\%) males) recruited from 7 HD centers, from all main    geographical regions of Romania. The prevalence of DM was 15.3\%. They    were then followed regarding: dialysis duration, dialysis efficiency,    renal anemia, CKD-MBD, inflammatory status and comorbidities: coronary    artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and stroke. The    deficiency of 25-OH vitamin D was defined as a value lower than 12    ng/mL.    Results    Patients were followed for 3 years. The overall 3 year mortality was    25.5\% (153 individuals), being higher in patients with DM as compared    to those without DM (33.7\% vs. 24.0\%; P = 0.049). The time-related    prognosis was also influenced by the presence of DM, at the survival    analysis resulting in a HR of 1.52 {[}1.03 to 2.26] 95\% CI, P = 0.037,    for death in dialyzed patients with DM. In DM patients, 25-OH vitamin D    deficiency was significantly higher (37.0\% compared to 24.0\%, P =    0.009).

In multiple Cox proportional    hazards analysis, vitamin D deficiency remained an independent predictor    for mortality in dialysis patients with DM (HR = 1.71, 95\% CI 1.21 to    2.43, P = 0.003). In the same time, multiple Cox proportional hazards    analysis showed that age (HR = 1.02 per one year increase, P = 0.004),    CAD (HR = 1.55, P = 0.046) and PVD (HR = 1.50, P = 0.029) were    independent predictors for mortality in dialysis patients with DM.    Conclusions    ESRD patients with DM treated with HD have a higher overall mortality    than non-DM patients. Vitamin D deficiency is significantly more    prevalent in HD patients with DM. Low 25-OH vitamin D levels were    associated with increased all-cause mortality in these patients.

A mixture of    wide spectrum antibiotics (i.e. streptomycin, colistin and ampicillin)    or vancomycin alone were administered orally from the moment of    conception, treating breeding pairs, and during the postnatal and adult    life until the end of follow-up at 40 weeks. Diabetes incidence    significantly and similarly increased in male mice following treatment    with these two antibiotic regimens. In NOD females a slight yet not    significant trend towards an increase in disease incidence was observed.    Changes in gut microbiota composition were assessed by sequencing the V3    region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Administration of the antibiotic    mixture resulted in near complete ablation of the gut microbiota.    Vancomycin treatment led to increased Escherichia, Lactobacillus and    Sutterella genera and decreased members of the Clostridiales order and    Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae and Rikenellaceae families, as compared    to control mice. Massive elimination of IL-17-producing cells, both    CD4+TCR alpha beta+ and TCR gamma delta+ T cells was observed in the    lamina propria of the ileum and the colon of vancomycin-treated mice.    These results show that a directed even partial ablation of the gut    microbiota, as induced by vancomycin, significantly increases type 1    diabetes incidence in male NOD mice thus prompting for caution in the    use of antibiotics in pregnant women and newborns.}"ISI:000354545600003,"Pena, Michelle J.; Heinzel, Andreas; Heinze, Georg; Alkhalaf, Alaa; Bakker, Stephan J.

Research Design and Methods    A systematic data integration approach was used to select biomarkers    representing different disease pathways. Twenty-eight biomarkers were    measured in 82 patients seen at an outpatient diabetes center in The    Netherlands. Median follow-up was 4.0 years. We compared the    cross-validated explained variation (R-2) of two models to predict eGFR    decline, one including only established risk markers, the other adding a    novel panel of biomarkers. Least absolute shrinkage and selection    operator (LASSO) was used for model estimation. The C-index was    calculated to assess improvement in prediction of accelerated eGFR    decline defined as <-3.0 mL/min/1.73m(2)/year.    Results    Patients' average age was 63.5 years and baseline eGFR was 77.9    mL/min/1.73m(2). The average rate of eGFR decline was -2.0 +/- 4.7    mL/min/1.73m(2)/year. When modeled on top of established risk markers,    the biomarker panel including matrix metallopeptidases, tyrosine kinase,    podocin, CTGF, TNF-receptor-1, sclerostin, CCL2, YKL-40, and NT-proCNP    improved the explained variability of eGFR decline (R-2 increase from    37.7\% to 54.6\%; p=0.018) and improved prediction of accelerated eGFR    decline (C-index increase from 0.835 to 0.896; p=0.008).    Conclusions    A novel panel of biomarkers representing different pathways of renal    disease progression including inflammation, fibrosis, angiogenesis, and    endothelial function improved prediction of eGFR decline on top of    established risk markers in type 2 diabetes.

Materials and Methods    Using population-based representative insurance claims data in Taiwan,    36,270 DM patients and 145,080 comparison subjects without DM were    identified from claims from 2005 to 2010. The association between the    top ten leading causes of cancer-related death in Taiwan and DM was    evaluated. Whether ADT altered the risk of developing cancer was also    investigated.    Results    Incidence of cancer at any site was significantly higher in patients    with DM than in those without (p<0.001). The risk of carcinogenesis    imparted by DM was greatest in gastroenterological malignancies (liver,    pancreas, and colorectal cancer) as well as lung, breast and oral cancer    (p<0.001). Among the oral types of ADT, metformin decreased the risk of    lung and liver cancer, but had less effect on reducing the risk of    colorectal cancer. alpha-glucosidase inhibitor decreased the risk of    developing liver, colorectal, and breast cancer.

Various ocular    and systemic risk factors for impairment of colour vision (ICV) were    assessed in subjects with diabetes but no retinopathy. P value of < 0.05    was considered statistically significant.    Results    The mean age of the study sample was 57.08 +/- 9.21 (range: 44-86    years). Gender adjusted prevalence of ICV among subjects with diabetes    with no retinopathy was 39.5\% (CI: 33.5-45.5). The mean total error    score in the study sample was 197.77 +/- 100 (range: 19-583). The risk    factors for ICV in the study were women OR: 1.79 (1.00-3.18), increased    resting heart rate OR: 1.04 (1.01-1.07) and increased intraocular    pressure OR: 1.12 (1.00-1.24). Significant protective factor was serum    high-density lipoprotein OR: 0.96 (0.93-0.99).    Conclusions    Acquired ICV is an early indicator of neurodegenerative changes in the    retina. ICV found in diabetic subjects without retinopathy may be of    non-vascular etiology.}"ISI:000356327000080,"Ku, Eu Jeong; Jung, Kyong Yeon; Kim, Yoon Ji; Kim, Kyoung Min; Moon, Jae Hoon; Choi, Sung Hee; Cho, Young Min; Park, Kyong Soo; Jang, Hak Chul; Lim, Soo & Ahren, Bo",Four-Year Durability of Initial Combination Therapy with Sitagliptin and Metformin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in Clinical Practice; COSMIC Study,{PLOS ONE},{10},{6},{JUN 12},,2015,,,,,,,,,"{Objectives    We investigated the efficacy of initial combination therapy with    sitagliptin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes for 4 years    in clinical practice.

After excluding 288 patients without a    second follow-up, 890 individuals (age, 58.0 +/- 12.5 years; BMI, 25.4    +/- 3.5 kg/m(2); HbA(1c), 8.6 +/- 1.1\%) were followed up with every 3-6    months for 4 years. Homeostasis model assessments for insulin resistance    and beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) were recorded at baseline. The    response criterion was HbA(1c) reduction by >= 0.8\% from baseline or    attainment of the target HbA(1c) (<= 7.0\% or 53 mmol/mol). At the end    of every year of treatment, changes in HbA(1c) from the baseline were    assessed.

After 4 years, 35.4\% of the patients still    showed a response, with an HbA(1c) level of 7.0 +/- 0.9\%. A high    HbA(1c) level at baseline was the most significant independent predictor    of the long-term response (P<0.001).

Preventive efforts require population wide measures to    address its social determinants. We undertook a systematic review to    determine current knowledge about the social distribution of diabetes,    its risk factors and major complications in the Caribbean. This paper    describes our findings on the distribution by gender.    Methods    We searched Medline, Embase and five databases through the Virtual    Health Library, for Caribbean studies published between 2007 and 2013    that described the distribution by gender for: known risk factors for    Type 2 DM, prevalence of DM, and DM control or complications. PRISMA    guidance on reporting systematic reviews on health equity was followed.    Only quantitative studies (n>50) were included; each was assessed for    risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed, where appropriate, on    studies with a low or medium risk of bias, using random effects models.    Results    We found 50 articles from 27 studies, yielding 118 relationships between    gender and the outcomes. Women were more likely to have DM, obesity, be    less physically active but less likely to smoke. In meta-analyses of    good quality population-based studies odds ratios for women vs. men for    DM, obesity and smoking were: 1.65 (95\% CI 1.43, 1.91), 3.10 (2.43,    3.94), and 0.24 (0.17, 0.34). Three studies found men more likely to    have better glycaemic control but only one achieved statistical    significance.    Conclusion and Implications    Female gender is a determinant of DM prevalence in the Caribbean. In the    vast majority of world regions women are at a similar or lower risk of    type 2 diabetes than men, even when obesity is higher in women.    Caribbean female excess of diabetes may be due to a much greater excess    of risk factors in women, especially obesity.

We demonstrated the use of graphical Markov    modelling to identify the importance and interrelationships of a number    of possible variables changed as a result of a lifestyle intervention,    whilst considering fixed factors such as genetic predisposition, on    changes in traits. Paths which led to weight loss and change in dietary    saturated fat were important factors in the change of all glycaemic    traits, whereas the T2DM-GPS only made a significant direct contribution    to changes in HOMA-IR and plasma glucose after considering the effects    of lifestyle factors. This analysis shows that modifiable factors    relating to body weight, diet, and physical activity are more likely to    impact on glycaemic traits than genetic predisposition during a    behavioural intervention.}"ISI:000358162300104,"Hong, Daqing; Zhang, Yuan; Gao, Bixia; Wang, Jinwei; Li, Guisen; Wang, Li; Zhang, Luxia & Grp, China Natl Survey C.

The study of the    relationship between them is important. The CKD survey, a national    cross-sectional study, provided a large database to accomplish this    study. The study population were 41 131 adults from this survey between    2008 and 2009. CKD was defined as estimate glomerular filtration rate    (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) or the presence of albuminuria.    MS was diagnosed by National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult    Treatment Panel III (ATPIII), ATPIII-modified or International Diabetes    Federation (IDF) criteria. Logistic regression model was applied to    study the impact of MS or its components on CKD or its components. The    age and sex standardized prevalence of MS by ATPIII, ATPIII-modified and    IDF criteria was 11.77\% (11.13\%-12.40\%), 21.51\% (20.69\%-22.34\%)    and 16.67\% (15.92-17.42)\% respectively. Multivariate logistic    regression models showed that MS and its components were associated with    higher CKD prevalence. The risk for CKD and its components increased    with the number of MS components. After adjusting for hypertension and    diabetes, the odds ratios of MS for CKD decreased, but remained    significantly more than 1 between 1.16(95\% CI 1.07-1.26) and 1.37 (95\%    CI 1.25-1.50) across the different models. Similar results were found    with albuminuria, while for decreased eGFR, after adjusting for    hypertension and diabetes, the odds ratios of MS and MS components    (except elevated TG) became insignificant. In conclusion, MS is    prevalent and associated with a higher prevalence of CKD. Different MS    components are associated with different risks for CKD, even after    adjusting for hypertension and diabetes, which may mainly be contributed    more by the increased risk for albuminuria than that for decreased eGFR.    More attention must be paid to the population with MS, including those    with elevated blood pressure and serum glucose.}"ISI:000358194900035,"Carvalho, Marilia Sa; Coeli, Claudia Medina; Chor, Dora; Pinheiro, Rejane Sobrino; Mendes da Fonseca, Maria de Jesus & de Sa Carvalho, Luiz Carlos",The Challenge of Cardiovascular Diseases and Diabetes to Public Health: A Study Based on Qualitative Systemic Approach,{PLOS ONE},{10},{7},{JUL 14},,2015,,,,,,,,,"{The most common modeling approaches to understanding incidence,    prevalence and control of chronic diseases in populations, such as    statistical regression models, are limited when it comes to dealing with    the complexity of those problems.

However, evidence suggests discordance    between HbA(1c) and FPG. In this study we examine a range of metabolic    risk features, pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute-phase response    proteins, coagulation factors and white blood cell counts to determine    which assay more accurately identifies individuals at increased    cardiometabolic risk.    Materials and Methods    This was a cross-sectional study involving a random sample of 2,047 men    and women aged 46-73 years. Binary and multinomial logistic regression    were employed to examine risk feature associations with pre-diabetes    {[}either HbA1c levels 5.7-6.4\%(39-46 mmol/mol) or impaired FPG levels    5.6-6.9 mmol/l] and type 2 diabetes {[}either HbA1c levels > 6.5\% (> 48    mmol/mol) or FPG levels > 7.0 mmol/l]. Receiver operating characteristic    curve analysis was used to evaluate the ability of HbA(1c) to    discriminate pre-diabetes and diabetes defined by FPG.    Results    Stronger associations with diabetes-related phenotypes were observed in    pre-diabetic subjects diagnosed by FPG compared to those detected by    HbA(1c). Individuals with type 2 diabetes exhibited cardiometabolic    profiles that were broadly similar according to diagnosis by either    assay. Pre-diabetic participants classified by both assays displayed a    more pro-inflammatory, pro-atherogenic, hypertensive and insulin    resistant profile. Odds ratios of having three or more metabolic    syndrome features were also noticeably increased (OR: 4.0, 95\% CI:    2.8-5.8) when compared to subjects diagnosed by either HbA(1c) (OR: 1.4,    95\% CI: 1.2-1.8) or FPG (OR: 3.0, 95\% CI: 1.7-5.1) separately.    Conclusions    In middle-aged Caucasian-Europeans, HbA(1c) alone is a poor indicator of    cardiometabolic risk but is suitable for diagnosing diabetes.

Objective    We measured the prevalence of SCH in T2DM population, and investigated    whether T2DM increase the risk of SCH and whether SCH was associated    with diabetic complications.    METHODS    We conducted a meta-analysis using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Wan    Fang, CNKI and VIP databases for literature search. We obtained studies    published between January 1, 1980 to December 1, 2014. The studies were    selected to evaluate the prevalence of SCH in T2DM subjects, compare the    prevalence of SCH in T2DM subjects with those nondiabetics, and    investigate whether diabetic complications were more prevalent in SCH    than those who were euthyroid. Fixed and random effects meta-analysis    models were used, and the outcome was presented as a pooled prevalence    with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) or a summary odds ratio (OR)    with 95\% CI.    RESULTS    Through literature search, 36 articles met the inclusion criteria and    these articles contained a total of 61 studies.

Trim and fill method was used to correct the results and five potential    missing data were replaced respectively. The adjusted pooled prevalence    of SCH in T2DM patients was 10.2\%, meanwhile, T2DM was associated with    a 1.93-fold increase in risk of SCH (95\% CI: 1.66, 2.24). Furthermore,    SCH might affect the development of diabetic complications with an    overall OR of 1.74 (95\% CI: 1.34, 2.28) for diabetic nephropathy, 1.42    (95\% CI: 1.21, 1.67) for diabetic retinopathy, 1.85 (95\% CI: 1.35,    2.54) for peripheral arterial disease, and 1.87 (95\% CI: 1.06, 3.28)    for diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

The    architecture of our proposed method is designed based on how a medical    doctor concluded related to indication that someone has the potential    against DM, which is the model has been adjusted with the data we have    obtained from the authorities in the laboratory. As a form of evaluation    that we do, we did a comparison of the data we have obtained from our    method with the medical doctor decision which is equipped with the data    from laboratory, and the result is 87.46\% of the 311 relevant data is    equal to medical doctor's statement. In interpreting the conclusions    that we get with the hospitals that cooperate with us, the results    showed that the method we propose has meet the needs of the    effectiveness and efficiency in performing early detection against DM    and can help people in knowing the potential of DM since early.

We analyzed ethnic differences in handgrip strength, and its    association with type 2 diabetes mellitus using logistic regression    analyses adjusted for socio-demographic factors, body composition and    lifestyle factors. Additionally, we investigated whether handgrip    strength explained the ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes mellitus.    We found that handgrip strength differed significantly across ethnic    groups. After full adjustment, we found an inverse association with type    2 diabetes mellitus (OR 0.95; 95\% CI 0.92-0.97) that did not differ    substantially between ethnic groups, men and among women, and lean and    overweight individuals. The association was not affected by the measure    used to define type 2 diabetes mellitus, but was attenuated by exclusion    of people with known diabetes. The ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes    mellitus were not explained by handgrip strength (e.g. the OR for the    South Asian Surinamese vs. Dutch changed from 5.03; 3.69-6.68 to 4.87;    3.57-6.65). In conclusion, we found large ethnic differences in handgrip    strength and a consistent association of low handgrip strength with    prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus. This suggests that handgrip strength    may be investigated as a target for intervention or a marker to identify    people at risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.}"ISI:000361792100006,"Whetzel, Patricia L.; Grethe, Jeffrey S.; Banks, Davis E. & Martone, Maryann E.","The NIDDK Information Network: A Community Portal for Finding Data, Materials, and Tools for Researchers Studying Diabetes, Digestive, and Kidney Diseases",{PLOS ONE},{10},{9},{SEP 22},,2015,,,,,,,,,"{The NIDDK Information Network (dkNET; http://dknet.org) was launched to    serve the needs of basic and clinical investigators in metabolic,    digestive and kidney disease by facilitating access to research    resources that advance the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes    and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).

It is widely advocated that multiple    imputation is superior to other imputation methods, however studies have    suggested that simple methods for filling missing data can be just as    accurate as complex methods. The objective of this study was to    implement a number of simple and more complex imputation methods, and    assess the effect of these techniques on the performance of undiagnosed    diabetes risk prediction models during external validation.    Methods    Data from the Cape Town Bellville-South cohort served as the basis for    this study. Imputation methods and models were identified via recent    systematic reviews. Models' discrimination was assessed and compared    using C-statistic and non-parametric methods, before and after    recalibration through simple intercept adjustment.    Results    The study sample consisted of 1256 individuals, of whom 173 were    excluded due to previously diagnosed diabetes. Of the final 1083    individuals, 329 (30.4\%) had missing data. Family history had the    highest proportion of missing data (25\%). Imputation of the outcome,    undiagnosed diabetes, was highest in stochastic regression imputation    (163 individuals). Overall, deletion resulted in the lowest model    performances while simple imputation yielded the highest C-statistic for    the Cambridge Diabetes Risk model, Kuwaiti Risk model, Omani Diabetes    Risk model and Rotterdam Predictive model. Multiple imputation only    yielded the highest C-statistic for the Rotterdam Predictive model,    which were matched by simpler imputation methods.    Conclusions    Deletion was confirmed as a poor technique for handling missing data.    However, despite the emphasized disadvantages of simpler imputation    methods, this study showed that implementing these methods results in    similar predictive utility for undiagnosed diabetes when compared to    multiple imputation.}"ISI:000362171400020,"Zwakenberg, Sabine R.; Gundberg, Caren M.; Spijkerman, Annemieke M.

Results    The number of comorbid diseases significantly influenced the SBP trend,    with highest values after five years for diabetes patients without    comorbidity (p = 0.005). The number of diseases did not influence the    HbA(1)C trend (p = 0.075).

If not used after    conception, OHAs did not reduce the risk of GDM (adjusted OR = 1.20;    95\% CI: 0.88-1.62).    Conclusions    A history of PCOS is a significant and independent risk factor for    development of GDM. Medication for PCOS or pre-pregnancy use of OHAs    does not reduce the risk of GDM. When at-risk women become pregnant,    they require closer surveillance for maternal and fetal well-being, and    should follow a strict diet and adhere to weight gain control to avoid    obstetric complications due to GDM.}"ISI:000363271300015,"Altikardes, Zehra Aysun; Erdal, Hasan; Baba, A.

Firstly, sixty-five patients (mean age 51 +/- 7 years, 40 females,) were    included in the study. Systolic and diastolic dipping were found in 13    and 15 \% of the patients, respectively. In the advancing process of the    experiment, the number of instances were reduced, because of some    missing data of the patients. The data sets were tested using the J48    decision tree algorithm. This classification algorithm was implemented    on 56 instances, and also the number of attributes was reduced from 35    to 23. 66 \% of the instances (37) were reserved for training and 44 \%    of the instances (19) were reserved for testing. When the algorithm was    run, the Non-Dipper/Dipper pattern of the instances were correctly    predicted in a rate of 73.6842 \%. Model was built in 0.02 seconds.

Background: Depression is a common and often undiagnosed condition for    patients with diabetes. It is also a condition that significantly    impacts healthcare outcomes, use, and cost as well as elevating suicide    risk. Therefore, a model to predict depression among diabetes patients    is a promising and valuable tool for providers to proactively assess    depressive symptoms and identify those with depression.    Objectives: This study seeks to develop a generalized multilevel    regression model, using a longitudinal data set from a recent    large-scale clinical trial, to predict depression severity and presence    of major depression among patients with diabetes.    Methods: Severity of depression was measured by the Patient Health    Questionnaire PHQ-9 score. Predictors were selected from 29 candidate    factors to develop a 2-level Poisson regression model that can make    population-average predictions for all patients and subject-specific    predictions for individual patients with historical records. Newly    obtained patient records can be incorporated with historical records to    update the prediction model. Root-mean-square errors (RMSE) were used to    evaluate predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores. The study also evaluated    the classification ability of using the predicted PHQ-9 scores to    classify patients as having major depression.    Results: Two time-invariant and 10 time-varying predictors were selected    for the model. Incorporating historical records and using them to update    the model may improve both predictive accuracy of PHQ-9 scores and    classification ability of the predicted scores. Subject-specific    predictions (for individual patients with historical records) achieved    RMSE about 4 and areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)    curve about 0.9 and are better than population-average predictions.

This may be related to    genetic differences. Thus, rs7968585, a single nucleotide polymorphism    (SNP) of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), has recently been reported as a    predictor of composite health outcome. We therefore aimed to evaluate    whether rs7968585 predicts separate clinical outcomes such as T2D, MI,    cancer, and mortality in a community-based Norwegian population.    Methods and Findings    Measurements and DNA were obtained from the participants in the Tromso    Study in 1994-1995, registered with the outcomes of interest and a    randomly selected control group. The impact of the rs7968585 genotypes    was evaluated with Cox proportional hazards.

Mean follow-up time    from birth was 60.8 years for T2D and MI, 61.2 years for cancer, while    mean follow-up time from examination date was 16.5 years for survival.    Mean serum 25(OH) D levels did not differ across the rs7968585    genotypes. With the major homozygote genotype as reference, the minor    homozygote subjects had hazard ratios of 1.25 (95\% CI 1.05-1.49) for    T2D and 1.14 (1.02-1.28) for MI (P = 0.011 and 0.023, respectively,    without the Bonferroni correction).

Mice fed a high-fat diet were    treated with either ceftazidime (a primarily anti-Gram negative bacteria    antibiotic) or vancomycin (mainly anti-Gram positive bacteria activity)    in an escalating three-dose regimen. We also dosed animals with a    well-known prebiotic weight-loss supplement, 10\% oligofructose    saccharide (10\% OFS). Vancomycin treated mice showed little weight    change and no improvement in glycemic control while ceftazidime and 10\%    OFS treatments induced significant weight loss. However, only    ceftazidime showed significant, dose dependent improvement in key    metabolic variables including glucose, insulin, protein tyrosine    tyrosine (PYY) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).

However, more predictors had significant    associations with diabetes and the strengths of associations tended to    be higher than for the association with pre-diabetes. For instance, the    relative risk ratios for the association between diabetes and being    overweight (RRR = 2.00, 95\% CI = 1.55, 2.57), or obese (RRR = 4.04,    95\% CI = 3.22, 5.07), hypertensive (RRR = 2.66, 95\% CI = 2.08, 3.41),    hypercholesterolemic (RRR = 1.98, 95\% CI = 1.61, 2.45) and arthritic    (RRR = 1.28, 95\% CI = 1.04, 1.58) were all further away from the null    than their associations with pre-diabetes. Moreover, a number of    variables such as age, income level, sex, and level of physical activity    had significant association with diabetes but not pre-diabetes. The risk    of diabetes increased with increasing age, lower income, in males, and    with physical inactivity. Insufficient physical activity had no    significant association with the risk of diabetes or prediabetes.    Conclusions    There is evidence of differences in the strength of association of the    predictors across levels of diabetes status (pre-diabetes and diabetes)    among adults >= 18 years in Florida.

The main aim of our study was to compare the    cognitive function in children of diabetic and healthy pregnant women.    Methods    A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted through a literature    search using different electronic databases from the index date to    January 31, 2015.

Here, we compared the    clinical profile and disease outcomes of TB patients with or without    coincident DM in a TB reference center in Brazil.    Methods    We performed a retrospective analysis of a TB patient cohort (treatment    naive) of 408 individuals recruited at a TB primary care center in    Brazil between 2004 and 2010. Data on diagnosis of TB and DM were used    to define the groups. The study groups were compared with regard to TB    disease presentation at diagnosis as well as to clinical outcomes such    as cure and mortality rates upon anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT)    initiation. A composite score utilizing clinical, radiological and    microbiological parameters was used to compare TB severity between the    groups.    Results    DM patients were older than non-diabetic TB patients. In addition,    diabetic individuals more frequently presented with cough, night sweats,    hemoptysis and malaise than those without DM. The overall pattern of    lung lesions assessed by chest radiographic examination was similar    between the groups. Compared to non-diabetic patients, those with    TB-diabetes exhibited positive acid-fast bacilli in sputum samples more    frequently at diagnosis and at 30 days after ATT initiation. Notably,    higher values of the TB severity score were significantly associated    with TB-diabetes comorbidity after adjustment for confounding factors.    Moreover, during ATT, diabetic patients required more frequent transfers    to TB reference hospitals for complex clinical management. Nevertheless,    overall mortality and cure rates were indistinguishable between the    study groups.

Methods    75 patients with type 1 diabetes received PRIMAS through an RCT, whereas    179 patients were observed in an implementation trial. Baseline    characteristics and treatment outcomes at the 6-month follow-up    (improvement of HbA1c, hypoglycaemia problems, and diabetes-related    distress) were compared.    Results    At baseline, the type 1 diabetic patients in the RCT had a significant    longer diabetes duration (18.7 +/- 12.3 vs. 13.8 +/- 12.7 yrs., p=.005),    lower self-efficacy scores (21.9 +/- 4.7 vs. 23.7 +/- 6.1, p=.02) and a    greater number of diabetes complications (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 0.4 +/- 0.9,    p=.02). After 6 months, PRIMAS achieved comparable effects under RCT and    implementation trial conditions, as demonstrated by improvement in HbA1c    (-0.36\%+/- 1.1 vs. -0.37 +/- 1.2; Delta -0.01, 95\% CI -0.33 to 0.31)    and hypoglycaemia unawareness (-0.5 +/- 1.4 vs. -0.3 +/- 1.4; Delta    0.18, 95\% CI -0.21 to 0.57). The likelihood of clinical improvement did    not depend on the trial setting (RCT vs. IT: OR 1.18, 95\% CI 0.60 to    2.33).

Control and diabetic (db/db) mice (8 weeks of age) were randomized to    receive a unique intravenous injection of 5x10(5)EOCs or 0.25 ml thrice    weekly tail-vein injections of 10x concentrated CM and Wystar Kyoto rats    rendered diabetic were randomized to receive 0.50 ml thrice weekly    tail-vein injections of 10x concentrated CM.

Diabetic    animals showed increase in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and oxidative    damage markers; the treatment with EOCs or CM infusions significantly    reduced this damage and re-established the retinal function. In rMCs    exposed to diabetic milieu conditions (HG), the presence of EOC-CM    reduced reactive oxygen species production by modulating the    NADPH-oxidase 4 system, thus upregulating SIRT1 activity and    deacetylating Lys-310-p65-NF.B, decreasing GFAP and VEGF expressions.    The antioxidant capacity of EOC-CM led to the prevention of    carbonylation and nitrosylation posttranslational modifications on the    SIRT1 molecule, preserving its activity. The pivotal role of SIRT1 on    the mode of action of EOCs or their CM was also demonstrated on diabetic    retina.

We quantify the association between Finnish Diabetes Risk    Score (FINDRISC) and HRQoL, and examine the potential use of FINDRISC as    tool to evaluate HRQoL indirectly.    Methods    We conducted a cross-sectional study comprising 707 Finnish people    without a diagnosis of T2D between the ages of 51 and 75 years. The risk    of developing T2D was assessed using the validated and widely used    FINDRISC (range 0-26 points), and quality of life was measured using two    preference-based HRQoL instruments (15D and SF-6D) and one health    profile instrument (SF-36). Effects of the individual FINDRISC items and    demographic and clinical characteristics, such as co-morbidities, on    HRQoL were studied using multivariable Tobit regression models.    Results    Low HRQoL was significantly and directly associated with the estimated    risk of developing T2D. An approximate 4-5 point change in FINDRISC    score was observed to be associated with clinically noticeable changes    in the preference-based instrument HRQoL index scores.    The association between HRQoL and the risk of developing T2D was also    observed for most dimensions of HRQoL in all applied HRQoL instruments.    Overall, old age, lack of physical activity, obesity, and history of    high blood glucose were the FINDRISC factors most prominently associated    with lower HRQoL.

Purpose: To use data mining techniques to develop a model for predicting    the development of liver cancer within 6 years of diagnosis with type II    diabetes.    Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research    Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, which covers approximately 22 million    people. In this study, we selected patients who were newly diagnosed    with type II diabetes during the 2000-2003 periods, with no prior cancer    diagnosis. We then used encrypted personal ID to perform data linkage    with the cancer registry database to identify whether these patients    were diagnosed with liver cancer. Finally, we identified 2060 cases and    assigned them to a case group (patients diagnosed with liver cancer    after diabetes) and a control group (patients with diabetes but no liver    cancer). The risk factors were identified from the literature review and    physicians' suggestion, then, chi-square test was conducted on each    independent variable (or potential risk factor) for a comparison between    patients with liver cancer and those without, those found to be    significant were selected as the factors. We subsequently performed data    training and testing to construct artificial neural network (ANN) and    logistic regression (LR) prediction models. The dataset was randomly    divided into 2 groups: a training group and a test group. The training    group consisted of 1442 cases (70\% of the entire dataset), and the    prediction model was developed on the basis of the training group. The    remaining 30\% (618 cases) were assigned to the test group for model    validation.    Results: The following 10 variables were used to develop the ANN and LR    models: sex, age, alcoholic cirrhosis, nonalcoholic cirrhosis, alcoholic    hepatitis, viral hepatitis, other types of chronic hepatitis, alcoholic    fatty liver disease, other types of fatty liver disease, and    hyperlipidemia. The performance of the ANN was superior to that of LR,    according to the sensitivity (0.757), specificity (0.755), and the area    under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.873). After    developing the optimal prediction model, we base on this model to    construct a web-based application system for liver cancer prediction,    which can provide support to physicians during consults with diabetes    patients.    Conclusion: In the original dataset (n = 2060), 33\% of diabetes    patients were diagnosed with liver cancer (n = 515). After using 70\% of    the original data to training the model and other 30\% for testing, the    sensitivity and specificity of our model were 0.757 and 0.755,    respectively; this means that 75.7\% of diabetes patients can be    predicted correctly to receive a future liver cancer diagnosis, and    75.5\% can be predicted correctly to not be diagnosed with liver cancer.    These results reveal that this model can be used as effective predictors    of liver cancer for diabetes patients, after discussion with physicians;    they also agreed that model can assist physicians to advise potential    liver cancer patients and also helpful to decrease the future cost    incurred upon cancer treatment.

In the present    study, we investigated the role of vanin-1 in the development of hepatic    steatosis and insulin resistance in animal models of obesity and    diabetes. In addition, we evaluated the potency of RR6, a novel    pharmacological vanin-1 inhibitor, as an antidiabetic drug.

Methods and Results    Leukocyte count and its subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes and mixed    cells) were analyzed in 26,667 men and women, 45-73 years old, from the    population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer study. Information about the    R262W polymorphism (rs3184504) in SH2B3 was genotyped in 24,489    subjects. Incidence of diabetes was studied during a mean follow-up of    14 years.

Results    The literature search yielded 963 records of potential interest, of    which 30 were included in the systematic review and 22 in the    meta-analysis. Most of these RCTs were conducted in the United States in    patients in outpatient clinics using face-to-face contact only. All RCTs    performed patient education, and most executed the medication review.    The appraised sample showed uncertain or high risk of bias in most of    the items evaluated, resulting in low-quality studies. In comparison    with usual care, pharmacist interventions were associated with    significant reductions in HbA1c levels (-8.5\% {[}95\% CI: -1.06,    -0.65]; P < 0.0001; I-2 = 67.3\%). Subgroup analysis indicated    differences of heterogeneity by country, baseline HbA1c levels, setting,    intervention frequency, and random allocation. Age and HbA1c levels    partly explained the variability across studies by meta-regression.    Conclusions    Our findings confirmed that pharmacist interventions improve glycemic    control in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with usual care and    suggest that younger patients or with higher baseline HbA1c levels may    be the main beneficiaries of pharmacist care.

Such a condition disappears just after    delivery, but it is an indicator of the insurgence of diabetes type 2    (DT2) later in life: about 40\% of the women affected by GDM also    develop DT2 {[}Diabetes Care 25(10) (2002), 1862-1868]. GDM brings    several complications during pregnancy to both the mother and the fetus.    The aim is to present a personal health system (PHS) for monitoring GDM    and to present the results of outpatient monitoring and management by    utilizing a PHS for GDM.    METHODS: The Personal Health System (PHS) was deployed in a feasibility    study, modelled as a single-center, parallel group, open randomized    controlled trial conducted in Lausanne University Hospital. Patients (n    = 24) were assigned to 2 different groups: standard protocol group (SP)    and telemedicine group (TM). SP patients were managed by regular clinic    visits. TM patients were managed with our EPHS system. The targeted    feasibility outcome was whole trial feasibility, functioning of the PHS    and its appropriateness for patient use.    RESULTS: Mean age was 32 +/- 5 years and patients were pregnant for 29.1    +/- 1.9 weeks at study inclusion. Patients came from 16 different    countries. The follow-up rate was 100\%. Acceptability in the TM-group    was high, as 100\% were satisfied with the care provided and equally    100\% were at ease with the technology. Overall median{[}IQR] glucose    control was 5.4 mmol/l {[}4.7-6.4] in the TM-group and 5.7 mmol/l    {[}4.9-6.7] in the SP-group (p < 0.001). Four out of 6 daily plasma    glucose values were significantly better controlled with telemedicine    compared to standard care.    CONCLUSION: The feasibility study that was conducted shows that PHSs    have a great potential to improve the life of the patient by allowing a    better communication of their physiological values to the caregivers.    With respect to the particular case of GDM, the study suggests that use    of PHS technology may improve glycaemic control in GDM, but to confirm    this trend, a main trial is needed.}"ISI:000373222000003,"Ignell, Claes; Ekelund, Magnus; Anderberg, Eva & Berntorp, Kerstin",Model for individual prediction of diabetes up to 5 years after gestational diabetes mellitus,{SPRINGERPLUS},{5},,{MAR 11},,2016,,,,,,,,,"{Aims: To identify predictors of diabetes development up to 5 years after    gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and to develop a prediction model    for individual use.    Methods: Five years after GDM, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)    was performed in 362 women, excluding women already diagnosed with    diabetes at 1-to 2-year follow-up or later (n = 45). All but 21 women    had results from follow-up at 1-2 years, while 84 women were lost from    that point. Predictive variables were identified by logistic regression    analysis.    Results: Five years after GDM, 28/362 women (8 \%) were diagnosed with    diabetes whereas 187/362 (52 \%) had normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Of    the latter, 139/187 (74 \%) also had NGT at 1-to 2-year follow-up. In    simple regression analysis, using NGT at 1-2 years and at 5 years as the    reference, diabetes at 1-to 2-year follow-up or later was clearly    associated with easily assessable clinical variables, such as BMI at    1-to 2-year follow-up, 2-h OGTT glucose concentration during pregnancy,    and non-European origin (P < 0.0001).

Results Fifteen participants in the MoDD randomized controlled trial    were recruited for the qualitative interviews. Usage log analysis showed    that, on average, during the 4 weeks of the study, the study    participants logged into MoDD twice per week, reported 120 blood glucose    readings, and set two behavioral goals. The qualitative interviews    suggested that individuals used MoDD to follow the steps of the    problem-solving process, from identifying problematic blood glucose    patterns, to exploring behavioral triggers contributing to these    patterns, to selecting alternative behaviors, to implementing these    behaviors while monitoring for improvements in glycemic control.    Discussion This qualitative study suggested that informatics    interventions for reflection and problem solving can provide structured    scaffolding for facilitating these processes by guiding users through    the different steps of the problem-solving process and by providing them    with context-sensitive evidence and practice-based knowledge related to    diabetes self-management on each of those steps.    Conclusion This qualitative study suggested that MoDD was perceived as a    useful tool in engaging individuals in self-monitoring, reflection, and    problem solving.}"ISI:000374291800051,"Smit, Jesper; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich; Schonheyder, Henrik Carl; Nielsen, Henrik; Froslev, Trine & Sogaard, Mette",Outcome of Community-Acquired Staphylococcus aureus Bacteraemia in Patients with Diabetes: A Historical Population-Based Cohort Study,{PLOS ONE},{11},{4},{APR 15},,2016,,,,,,,,,"{Background    Patients with diabetes (DM) experience increased risk of Staphylococcus    aureus bacteraemia (SAB), but the prognostic impact of diabetes in    patients with SAB remain unclear.

Methods    We genotyped 7,620 Japanese participants (5,817 type 2 diabetes patients    and 1,803 controls) for each of the single nucleotide polymorphisms    (SNPs) using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction invader assay.

Our study's main aim is to    evaluate the possible association between the presence and severity of    DN and both the balance impairment and the risk of falls in patients    with T2DM.    Material and Method    In this cross-sectional study we enrolled, according to a    consecutive-case population-based setting 198 patients with T2DM. The    presence and severity of DN was evaluated using the Michigan Neuropathy    Screening Instrument, a tool which allows both diagnosing and severity    staging of DN.

A post-hoc analysis of a before and after study,{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS},{90},,{JUN},{58-67},2016,,,,,,,,,"{Objective: Most preventable adverse drug events and medication errors    occur during medication ordering. Medication order entry and clinical    decision support are available on paper or as computerized systems. In    this post-hoc analysis we investigated frequency and clinical impact of    blood glucose (BG) documentation-and user-related calculation errors as    well as workflowdeviations in diabetes management. We aimed to compare a    paper-based protocol to a computerized medication management system    combined with clinical workflow and decision support.    Methods: Seventy-nine hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes    mellitus were treated with an algorithm driven basal-bolus insulin    regimen. BG measurements, which were the basis for insulin dose    calculations, were manually entered either into the paper-based workflow    protocol (PaperG: 37 patients) or into GlucoTab (R)-a mobile tablet PC    based system (CompG: 42 patients). We used BG values from the laboratory    information system as a reference. A workflow simulator was used to    determine user calculation errors as well as workflow deviations and to    estimate the effect of errors on insulin doses. The clinical impact of    insulin dosing errors and workflow deviations on hypo- and hyperglycemia    was investigated.    Results: The BG documentation error rate was similar for PaperG (4.9\%)    and CompG group (4.0\%). In PaperG group, 11.1\% of manual insulin dose    calculations were erroneous and the odds ratio (OR) of a hypoglycemic    event following an insulin dosing error was 3.1 (95\% CI: 1.4-6.8). The    number of BG values influenced by insulin dosing errors was eightfold    higher than in the CompG group. In the CompG group, workflow deviations    occurred in 5.0\% of the tasks which led to an increased likelihood of    hyperglycemia, OR 2.2 (95\% CI: 1.1-4.6). Discussion: Manual insulin    dose calculations were the major source of error and had a particularly    strong influence on hypoglycemia. By using GlucoTab (R), user    calculation errors were entirely excluded. The immediate availability    and automated handling of BG values from medical devices directly at the    point of care has a high potential to reduce errors. Computerized    systems facilitate the safe use of more complex insulin dosing    algorithms without compromising usability. In CompG group, missed or    delayed tasks had a significant effect on hyperglycemia, while in PaperG    group insufficient precision of documentation times limited analysis.    The use of old BG measurements was clinically less relevant.    Conclusion: Insulin dosing errors and workflow deviations led to    measurable changes in clinical outcome. Diabetes management systems    including decision support should address nurses as well as physicians    in a computerized way. Our analysis shows that such systems reduce the    frequency of errors and therefore decrease the probability of hypo- and    hyperglycemia.

Other scores    showed AROCs that ranged from 0.697 to 0.782. For the prediction of    future diabetes, the KRS exhibited a sensitivity of 74\%, a specificity    of 54\%, and an AROC of 0.696. Other scores had AROCs ranging from 0.630    to 0.721. The laboratory prediction model composed of fasting plasma    glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels showed a significantly higher AROC    (0.838, P < 0.001) than the KRS. The addition of the KRS to the    laboratory prediction model increased the AROC (0.849, P = 0.016)    without a significant improvement in the risk classification (net    reclassification index: 4.6\%, P = 0.264).    Conclusions    The non-laboratory risk scores, including KRS, are useful to estimate    the risk of undiagnosed diabetes but are inferior to the laboratory    parameters for predicting future diabetes.}"ISI:000376882500017,"Arribas, Luis; Almansa, Inmaculada; Miranda, Maria; Muriach, Maria; Romero, Francisco J. & Villar, Vincent M.",Serum Malondialdehyde Concentration and Glutathione Peroxidase Activity in a Longitudinal Study of Gestational Diabetes,{PLOS ONE},{11},{5},{MAY 26},,2016,,,,,,,,,"{Aims    The main goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of oxidative    damage and to quantify its level in gestational diabetes.    Methods    Thirty-six healthy women and thirty-six women with gestational diabetes    were studied in the three trimesters of pregnancy regarding their levels    of oxidative stress markers. These women were diagnosed with diabetes in    the second trimester of pregnancy. Blood glucose levels after 100g    glucose tolerance test were higher than 190, 165 or 145 mg/dl, 1, 2 or 3    hours after glucose intake.    Results    The group of women with gestational diabetes had higher serum    malondialdehyde levels, with significant differences between groups in    the first and second trimester. The mean values of serum glutathione    peroxidase activity in the diabetic women were significantly lower in    the first trimester. In the group of women with gestational diabetes    there was a negative linear correlation between serum malondialdehyde    concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the second and    third trimester.    Conclusions    In this observational and longitudinal study in pregnant women, the    alterations attributable to oxidative stress were present before the    biochemical detection of the HbA1c increase.

The purpose    of this study was to assess the association of co-occurring depressive    symptoms and cardiometabolic abnormalities on risk of diabetes in a    representative sample of the English population aged 50 years and older.    Data were from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. The sample    comprised of 4454 participants without diabetes at baseline. High    depressive symptoms were based on a score of 4 or more on the 8-item    binary Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale.    Cardiometabolic abnormalities were defined as 3 or more cardiometabolic    risk factors (hypertension, impaired glycemic control, systemic    inflammation, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high    triglycerides, and central obesity). Cox proportional hazards    regressions assessed the association between co-occurring depressive    symptoms and cardiometabolic abnormalities with incidence of diabetes.    Multiple imputation by chained equations was performed to account for    missing data. Covariates included age, sex, education, income, smoking    status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and cardiovascular    comorbidity. The follow-up period consisted of 106 months, during which    193 participants reported a diagnosis of diabetes.

This would    enable prompt treatment of women with unrecognised type 2 diabetes, who    may otherwise go undetected until the gestational diabetes (GDM) screen.    We compare inter-ethnic antenatal screening practices to examine whether    the HbA1c test would be accessed by ethnicities most at risk of    diabetes, and we determined the prevalence of unrecognised type 2    diabetes and prediabetes in our pregnant population. This is an    observational study of pregnancies in Christchurch NZ during 2008-2010.    Utilising electronic databases, we matched maternal characteristics to    first-antenatal bloods, HbA1c, and GDM screens (glucose challenge tests    and oral glucose tolerance tests). Overall uptake of the first-antenatal    bloods versus GDM screening was 83.1\% and 53.8\% respectively in 11,580    pregnancies. GDM screening was lowest in Maori 39.3\%, incidence    proportion ratio (IPR) 0.77 (0.71, 0.84) compared with Europeans. By    including HbA1c with the first-antenatal bloods, the number screened for    diabetes increases by 28.5\% in Europeans, 40.0\% in Maori, 28.1\% in    Pacific People, and 26.7\% in `Others' (majority of Asian descent). The    combined prevalence of unrecognised type 2 diabetes and prediabetes by    NZ criteria, HbA1c >= 5.9\% (41mmol/mol), was 2.1\% in Europeans, Maori    4.7\% IPR 2.59 (1.71, 3.93), Pacific People 9.5\% IPR 4.76 (3.10, 7.30),    and `Others' 6.2\% IPR 2.99 (2.19, 4.07). Applying these prevalence data    to 2013 NZ national births data, routine antenatal HbA1c testing could    have identified type 2 diabetes in 0.44\% and prediabetes in 3.96\% of    women. Routine HbA1c measurement in early pregnancy is an ideal    screening opportunity, particularly benefitting vulnerable groups,    reducing ethnic disparities in antenatal diabetes screening. This    approach is likely to have world-wide relevance and applicability.

We performed our    analysis for two types of systems: (i) a ``comprehensive{''} Shared EHR    system (SEHRS), where each visit of a patient results in a single    document (progress note), and (ii) the Austrian ELGA system, which    allows four specific document types to be shared.    Results: 391,630 DM patients were identified, corresponding to 4.7\% of    the Austrian population. More than 90\% of the patients received health    services from more than one healthcare provider in one year. Both, the    SEHRS as well as ELGA would have multiplied the available information    during a patient visit in comparison to an isolated local EHR system;    the median ratio of external to local medical documents was between 1:1    for a typical visit at a primary care provider (SEHRS as well as ELGA)    and 39:1 (SEHRS) respectively 28:1 (ELGA) for a typical visit at a    hospital.    Conclusions: Due to the high degree of care fragmentation, there is an    obvious need for HIE for Austrian DM patients. Both, the SEHRS as well    as ELGA could provide a substantial contribution to informational    continuity of care in Austrian DM treatment. Hospitals and specialists    would have gained the most amount of external information, primary care    providers and pharmacies would have at least doubled their available    information. Despite being the most important potential feeders of a    national Shared EHR system according to our analysis, primary care    providers will not tap their full corresponding potential under the    current implementation scenario of ELGA.

Given the racial/ethnic differences in smoking patterns and incident    type 2 diabetes our objective was to evaluate the association between    tobacco use and insulin resistance (IR) as well as incident type 2    diabetes mellitus in a contemporary multiethnic cohort.    Methods and Results We studied 5,931 Multi-Ethnic Study of    Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants who at baseline were free of type 2    diabetes (fasting glucose >= 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) and/or use of    insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications) categorized by self-reported    tobacco status and reclassified by urinary cotinine (available in 58\%    of participants) as never, current or former tobacco users. The    association between tobacco use, IR (fasting plasma glucose, insulin,    and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR))    and incident diabetes over 10 years was evaluated using multivariable    linear regression and Cox proportional hazards models, respectively.    Mean age of the participants was 62 (+/- 10) years, 46\% were male, 41\%    Caucasian, 12\% Chinese, 26\% African American and 21\% Hispanic/Latino.    IR biomarkers did not significantly differ between current, former, and    never cigarette users (P > 0.10) but showed limited unadjusted    differences for users of cigar, pipe and smokeless tobacco (All P    <0.05). Fully adjusted models showed no association between dose or    intensity of tobacco exposure and any index of IR. When stratified into    participants that quit smoking vs. those who continued smoking during    the 10-year study there was no difference in serum glucose levels or    frequency of diabetes. In fully adjusted models, there was no    significant difference in diabetes risk between former or current    cigarette smokers compared to never smokers {[}HR (95\% CI) 1.02    (0.77,1.37) and 0.81 (0.52,1.26) respectively].    Conclusion    In a contemporary multi-ethnic cohort, there was no independent    association between tobacco use and IR or incident type 2 diabetes.

Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) is    often raised in states of inflammation, including diabetes, and    regulates inflammatory processes. In myeloid cells, a key cell type in    atherosclerosis, PGE(2) acts predominately through its Prostaglandin E    Receptor 4 (EP4; Ptger4) to modulate inflammation. The effect of    PGE(2)-mediated EP4 signaling specifically in myeloid cells on    atherosclerosis in the presence and absence of diabetes is unknown.    Because diabetes promotes atherosclerosis through increased arterial    myeloid cell accumulation, we generated a myeloid cell-targeted    EP4-deficient mouse model (EP4(M-/-)) of T1DM-accelerated atherogenesis    to investigate the relationship between myeloid cell EP4, inflammatory    phenotypes of myeloid cells, and atherogenesis. Diabetic mice exhibited    elevated plasma PGE metabolite levels and elevated Ptger4 mRNA in    macrophages, as compared with non-diabetic littermates. PGE(2) increased    II6, II1b, II23 and Ccr7 mRNA while reducing Tnfa mRNA through EP4 in    isolated myeloid cells. Consistently, the stimulatory effect of diabetes    on peritoneal macrophage II6 was mediated by PGE(2)-EP4, while    PGE(2)-EP4 suppressed the effect of diabetes on Tnfa in these cells. In    addition, diabetes exerted effects independent of myeloid cell EP4,    including a reduction in macrophage Ccr7 levels and increased early    atherogenesis characterized by relative lesional macrophage    accumulation. These studies suggest that this mouse model of T1DM is    associated with increased myeloid cell PGE(2)-EP4 signaling, which is    required for the stimulatory effect of diabetes on IL-6, markedly blunts    the effect of diabetes on TNF-alpha and does not modulate    diabetes-accelerated atherogenesis.}"ISI:000378859400028,"Pimpin, Laura; Wu, Jason H.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Butter Consumption and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease, Diabetes, and Total Mortality",{PLOS ONE},{11},{6},{JUN 29},,2016,,,,,,,,,"{Background    Dietary guidelines recommend avoiding foods high in saturated fat. Yet,    emerging evidence suggests cardiometabolic benefits of dairy products    and dairy fat. Evidence on the role of butter, with high saturated dairy    fat content, for total mortality, cardiovascular disease, and type 2    diabetes remains unclear. We aimed to systematically review and    meta-analyze the association of butter consumption with all-cause    mortality, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in general populations.    Methods and Findings    We searched 9 databases from inception to May 2015 without restriction    on setting, or language, using keywords related to butter consumption    and cardiometabolic outcomes. Prospective cohorts or randomized clinical    trials providing estimates of effects of butter intake on mortality,    cardiovascular disease including coronary heart disease and stroke, or    diabetes in adult populations were included. One investigator screened    titles and abstracts; and two reviewed full-text articles independently    in duplicate, and extracted study and participant characteristics,    exposure and outcome definitions and assessment methods, analysis    methods, and adjusted effects and associated uncertainty, all    independently in duplicate. Study quality was evaluated by a modified    Newcastle-Ottawa score. Random and fixed effects meta-analysis pooled    findings, with heterogeneity assessed using the I-2 statistic and    publication bias by Egger's test and visual inspection of funnel plots.    We identified 9 publications including 15 country-specific cohorts,    together reporting on 636,151 unique participants with 6.5 million    person-years of follow-up and including 28,271 total deaths, 9,783 cases    of incident cardiovascular disease, and 23,954 cases of incident    diabetes. No RCTs were identified. Butter consumption was weakly    associated with all-cause mortality (N = 9 country-specific cohorts; per    14g(1 tablespoon)/day: RR = 1.01, 95\% CI = 1.00, 1.03, P = 0.045); was    not significantly associated with any cardiovascular disease (N = 4; RR    = 1.00, 95\% CI = 0.98, 1.02; P = 0.704), coronary heart disease (N = 3;    RR = 0.99, 95\% CI = 0.96, 1.03; P = 0.537), or stroke (N = 3; RR =    1.01, 95\% CI = 0.98, 1.03; P = 0.737), and was inversely associated    with incidence of diabetes (N = 11; RR = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.93, 0.99; P =    0.021). We did not identify evidence for heterogeneity nor publication    bias.    Conclusions    This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests relatively small or    neutral overall associations of butter with mortality, CVD, and    diabetes.

Objective    We examined the chronic effects of exenatide alone on glucose metabolism    in pre-diabetic canines.    Design and Methods    After 10 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD), adult dogs received one injection    of streptozotocin (STZ, 18.5 mg/kg). After induction of pre-diabetes,    while maintained on HFD, animals were randomized to receive either    exenatide (n = 7) or placebo (n = 7) for 12 weeks. beta-Cell function    was calculated from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT,    expressed as the acute insulin response, AIR(G)), the oral glucose    tolerance test (OGTT, insulinogenic index) and the graded-hyperglycemic    clamp (clamp insulinogenic index). Whole-body insulin sensitivity was    assessed by the IVGTT. At the end of the study, pancreatic islets were    isolated to assess beta-cell function in vitro.    Results    OGTT: STZ caused an increase in glycemia at 120 min by 22.0\%    (interquartile range, IQR, 31.5\%) (P = 0.011). IVGTT: This protocol    also showed a reduction in glucose tolerance by 48.8\% (IQR, 36.9\%) (P    = 0.002).
