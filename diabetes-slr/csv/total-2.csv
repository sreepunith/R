By the endurance and hasty spread of diabetes, with increased number of ill condition, complications in the disease all over the world, several methodologies have been developed to predict and prevent this chronic disease. An early diagnosis of disease helps patients and medical experts to reduce the problem, risk and cost of medications. This paper presented an efficient system to predict diabetes and further complications with risk level. In this system, methods including genetic algorithm, nearest neighbor, and fuzzy rule-based system have been used in order to provide an accurate prediction system to prepare for presence of diabetes and complications. In this system, 235 individual's data were collected. The best subsets of features generated by the implemented algorithm include the most common risk factors such as age, family history, BMI, weight, smoking habit, alcohol habit and also factors related to the presence of other diabetes complications considered for predication of disease. The proposed system was prejudiced and the results showed to be more suitable by selecting best subset of features selected using variations of genetic algorithm depending on the types of nearest neighbor. The succeeded results produced 95.83% sensitivity, 95.50% accuracy and 86.95% specificity on impenetrable data which support the effectiveness of the system to predict the disease.",,,,6,,ieee-27,"Vijayan, V.

Common interferential factors, including humidity and the ratio of alveolar air in breath, are compensated or handled in the algorithm. Considering the intersubject variance of the components in breath, we build subject-specific prediction models to improve the accuracy of BGL prediction.

The objective of this study was to create a tool that    accurately predicts the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with    type 2 diabetes according to an oral hypoglycemic agent.    Materials and Methods. The model was based on a cohort of 33,067    patients with type 2 diabetes who were prescribed a single oral    hypoglycemic agent at the Cleveland Clinic between 1998 and 2006.    Competing risk regression models were created for coronary heart disease    (CHD), heart failure, and stroke, while a Cox regression model was    created for mortality. Propensity scores were used to account for    possible treatment bias. A prediction tool was created and internally    validated using tenfold cross-validation. The results were compared to a    Framingham model and a model based on the United Kingdom Prospective    Diabetes Study (UKPDS) for CHD and stroke, respectively.    Results and Discussion. Median follow-up for the mortality outcome was    769 days. The numbers of patients experiencing events were as follows:    CHD (3062), heart failure (1408), stroke (1451), and mortality (3661).    The prediction tools demonstrated the following concordance indices    (c-statistics) for the specific outcomes: CHD (0.730), heart failure    (0.753), stroke (0.688), and mortality (0.719). The prediction tool was    superior to the Framingham model at predicting CHD and was at least as    accurate as the UKPDS model at predicting stroke.    Conclusions. We created an accurate tool for predicting the risk of    stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and death in patients    with type 2 diabetes.

Studies support    screening and interventions for pre-diabetes, which results in serious    complications and diabetes. This study aimed at developing an    intelligence-based screening model for pre-diabetes that could assist    with decreasing the prevalence of diabetes through early identification    and subsequent interventions. Data from the Korean National Health and    Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) were used, excluding subjects    with diabetes. The KNHANES 2010 data (n = 4,685) were used for training    and internal validation, while data from KNHANES 2011 (n = 4,566) were    used for external validation. We developed a model to screen for    pre-diabetes using support vector machine (SVM), and performed a    systematic evaluation of the SVM model using internal and external    validation. We compared the performance of the SVM model with that of a    screening score model based on logistic regression analysis for    pre-diabetes that had been developed previously. Backward elimination    logistic regression resulted in associations between pre-diabetes and    age, sex, waist circumference, body mass index, alcohol intake, family    history of diabetes, and hypertension. The areas under the curves (AUCs)    for the SVM model in the internal and external datasets were 0.761 and    0.731, respectively, while the AUCs for the screening score model were    0.734 and 0.712, respectively. The SVM model developed in this study    performed better than the screening score model that had been developed    previously and may be more effective for pre-diabetes screening.}",,,,6,{978-1-4673-5127-0},ISI:000350201500031,"Yan, Ke & Zhang, David",A Novel Breath Analysis System for Diabetes Diagnosis,,,,,{165-169},2012,,"{International Conference on Computerized Healthcare (ICCH), Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA, DEC 17-18, 2012}",,{2012 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTERIZED HEALTHCARE (ICCH)},,,,,,,,,{IEEE Hong Kong Sect Comp Chapter; IEEE Comp Soc; Hong Kong Polytechn Univ},,,"{A noninvasive breath analysis system for diabetes diagnosis is proposed    in this paper.

The aim of    this paper is to develop a risk advisor model to predict the chances of    diabetes complications according to the changes in risk factors. As the    starting point, an inclusive list of (k) diabetes complications and (n)    their correlated predisposing factors are derived from the existing    endocrinology text books. A type of data meta-analysis has been done to    extract and combine the numeric value of the relationships between these    two. The whole n (risk factors) - k (complications) model was broken    down into k different (n-1) relationships and these (n-1) dependencies    were broken into n (1-1) models. Applying regression analysis (seven    patterns) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we created models to    show the (1-1) correspondence between factors and complications. Then    all 1-1 models related to an individual complication were integrated    using the naive Bayes theorem. Finally, a Bayesian belief network was    developed to show the influence of all risk factors and complications on    each other. We assessed the predictive power of the 1-1 models by R-2,    F-ratio and adjusted R-2 equations; sensitivity, specificity and    positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the final model    using real patient data. The results suggest that the best fitted    regression models outperform the predictive ability of an ANN model, as    well as six other regression patterns for all 1-1 models.}",,,,7,,ISI:000376493200001,"Wang, Anxin; Chen, Guojuan; Su, Zhaoping; Liu, Xiaoxue; Liu, Xiangtong; Li, Haibin; Luo, Yanxia; Tao, Lixin; Guo, Jin; Liu, Long; Chen, Shuohua; Wu, Shouling & Guo, Xiuhua",Risk scores for predicting incidence of type 2 diabetes in the Chinese population: the Kailuan prospective study,{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},{6},,{MAY 25},,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"{Few risk scores have been specifically developed to identify individuals    at high risk of type 2 diabetes in China. In the present study, we aimed    to develop such risk scores, based on simple clinical variables. We    studied a population-based cohort of 73,987 adults, aged 18 years and    over. After 5.35 +/- 1.59 years of follow-up, 4,726 participants    (9.58\%) in the exploration cohort developed type 2 diabetes and 2,327    participants (9.44\%) in the validation cohort developed type 2    diabetes. Age, gender, body mass index, family history of diabetes,    education, blood pressure, and resting heart rate were selected to form    the concise score with an area under the receiver operating    characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.67. The variables in the concise score    combined with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and triglyceride (TG) or use    of lipid-lowering drugs constituted the accurate score with an AUC value    of 0.77. The utility of the two scores was confirmed in the validation    cohort with AUCs of 0.66 and 0.77, respectively. In summary, the concise    score, based on non-laboratory variables, could be used to identify    individuals at high risk of developing diabetes within Chinese    population; the accurate score, which also uses FPG and TG data, is    better at identifying such individuals.}",,,,6,{978-1-4673-6798-1},ISI:000377335600156,"Cao, Ni; Zeng, Sisi; Shen, Feixia; Pan, Chuandi; Chen, Chengshui; Nguyen, Thanh & Chen, Jake",Predictive and Preventive Models for Diabetes Prevention using Clinical Information in Electronic Health Record,,,,,{867-874},2015,,"{IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine, Washington, DC, NOV 09-12, 2015}",,{PROCEEDINGS 2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE},,,{IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine-BIBM},"Huan, J; Miyano, S; Shehu, A; Hu, X; Ma, B; Rajasekaran, S; Gombar, VK; Schapranow, IM; Yoo, IH; Zhou, JY; Chen, B; Pai, V & Pierce, B",,,,,{IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Natl Sci Fdn},,,"{In this work, we constructed diabetes predictive models using electronic    health record data, which could potentially have better preventive power    than other diabetes predictive models known according to our knowledge.    Diabetes is one of the most common, costly and complicated diseases all    over the world, including China. To tackle the complexity of diabetes,    electronic health record has been widely used to support physicians in    integrated care. However, diabetes predictive models using electronic    health record may lack of preventive power when the clinical    measurements directly related to diabetes diagnosis criteria are used.    To overcome this limitation, we did not use glucose, insulin, C-peptide    and HbAIC clinical measurements in classifying diabetes patients. We    used decision-table and support vector machine algorithm to build    predictive models. As the result, our decision-table-based model    achieves accuracy of 0.879, AUC of 0.921, precision of 0.898 and recall    of 0.904, which is comparable with any known definition to diabetes. Our    support-vector-machine-based model achieves accuracy of 0.660, AUC of    0.584, precision of 0.652 and recall of 0.939.
